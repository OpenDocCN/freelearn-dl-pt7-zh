    feel tremendous inspiration and optimism about AI’s ability to help us out of
    some of the greatest challenges that face humanity. I moderate a monthly talk
    with Women in AI called *WAITalks*. Many of my questions during these monthly
    talks are recurring questions, largely centered on how the speakers broke into
    the field, what excites them most about AI, and what they wish others knew about
    their area of AI. There’s a lot of beauty and insight from how the various women
    working in AI, from research to corporate to entrepreneurship, answer the same
    set of questions.

    of her work involves ethics, we spent a great deal of time discussing the risks
    and inherent problems AI poses. After some time on that, I wanted to know what
    someone in her position looks forward to regarding AI. We hear so much about the
    promise of AI, and it’s always nice to get a sense of what diverse sets of people
    believe AI will help us with. Her answer blew me away. She said that because her
    work focuses so much on the legalities, risks, and biases AI poses, it would be
    easy for her to take on a pessimistic view of AI and its effect on humans across
    the world. But this wasn’t the case with her. She said she felt, more than ever,
    that AI will be foundational in helping us with the greatest problems humanity
    will face, from cancer to climate change to the social biases that plague us and

    AI for the common good as well as for commercial success. Firstly, we will take
    a look at how AI will revolutionize our economic systems and how we relate to
    money and value. There will be broad brushstrokes here. Then, we will take a look
    at the commercial level and how AI is fueling growth in MVPs. This will be an
    exploration into the kinds of integrations AI will enable at the goods and services
    level. The expansion of AI in how we’re governed will be the subject of our third
    section, particularly the intersection of public citizen data and how governments
    will choose to use data on their own citizens. Our fourth section will explore
    the use of AI in healthcare, and finally, our fifth section will offer some insights

    quantitative analysts or *quants* for a long time. Quants do statistical and mathematical
    modeling for financial and risk modeling problems and, in many cases, it has been
    a profitable career for those that were interested in *the sexiest job of the

    considering the financial industry as a whole is people-heavy, the adoption of
    AI has been competing with human jobs. Let’s take the example of trading and the
    use of algorithmic trading. This is the ability to program a set of instructions
    to account for different variables, such as volume, price, and time of day. In
    comparison to a human trader, an AI or algorithm can optimize for the purchase
    of certain shares and learn from successful past behaviors much faster. Deep learning
    can also be leveraged here, and the output of its performance can be used as input
    to further train the algorithmic trading platforms, which means that these complex
    systems can start to see patterns and recognize opportunities almost infinitely
    better than a human trader.

    AI transformation. In looking toward the future, we also see tremendous investment
    allocated specifically for AI expansion. A 2021 report by the **Organization for
    Economic Co-Operation and Development** (**OECD**) predicts that by 2024, global
    spending on AI will reach over $110 billion. In 2020, it was about half of this

    the industry as a whole. We’d like to end with a more philosophical view of what
    AI adoption means for the very concept of value, worth, and money from a product
    perspective. If you work in fintech and you support financial products, you’re
    likely concerned with not only the value this will deliver to your customers,
    but you’re also keeping an eye out for risks to the commercialization of your
    product. The financial examples in this section remind us of the importance of

    of financial products, you’re looking to harness AI/ML in a capacity where your
    product is helping someone improve some outcome. Help comes in all shapes and
    sizes. As you’re in the throes of ideation and looking to offer something the
    market needs, consider products that are helping someone to arrive at conclusions
    in a faster, easier, or otherwise more efficient way. Maybe it’s making your customers
    more profitable or minimizing their costs. Maybe it’s helping your customers predict
    future uncertainty. Maybe it’s offering them a way to expand their generational
    wealth and gain financial independence. Maybe your offering is using AI/ML to
    best understand your customer through personalization. There is immense value

    in terms of how you can best deliver revenue and value to your end users and your
    business. We find it best to think in terms of reverse thinking, which is imagining
    the final result your product will provide its users and working backward from
    that to craft a solution that fits that final result. Another great technique
    is using divergent thinking in your brainstorming during the ideation process.
    Whether your product is predicting, optimizing, or personalizing an experience
    for your customers, try to imagine other scenarios and use cases in which your
    product might be helpful. Now is the time to be experimental with your ideations
    in a way that most influences your customers to see AI/ML's value most prominently.

    customized for people with a specific illness or within specific demographic groups.

    healthcare that AI has been serving for some time. With the combination of robotics,
    computer vision, voice assistance, audio assistance, speech-to-text, and smart
    home tech, we have been applying and will continue to apply AI in contexts that
    can help individuals with disabilities related to sight, sound, smell, taste,
    touch, mobility, mental health, understanding, communication, and learning.

    assisting people with neurological conditions. Polly helps its customers physically
    see the world around them better with 360-degree vision and navigate within their
    home or outside, offers real-time prediction by analyzing eye-tracking technology
    to anticipate needs, and facilitates the communication of needs, thoughts, and
    desires to the people around them. Essentially, it’s a whole suite of products
    in one platform for a specific use case. Wheelmap is a crowdsourced navigation
    app that helps you find wheelchair-accessible routes, building on its knowledge
    through a community of users that participate in a feedback loop. Biped, a company
    that makes smart harnesses, has developed a product that fits like a backpack
    to assist blind and vision-impaired people with potential collision risks as they
    navigate the world.

    in with the use of AI applications. I teamed up with a colleague from my data
    science program to create my dream product in 2020\. It was a mental health-focused
    conversational AI that got to know you, established goals with you, and recorded
    your mood. We were interested in using AI to serve as a real-time journal and
    dashboard for self-reflection, with the option to share this data and dashboard
    with a therapist if you chose to work with one.

    other companies that were tackling mental health and suicide prevention in their
    own ways. Companies such as ResolveX are using AI to work with suicide hotlines
    to eliminate manual and administrative tasks so that the workers can focus on
    the human on the other end of the line. Woebot developed a chatbot using cognitive
    behavioral therapy techniques to help people battling depression and anxiety.

    and release cycle, but the good of all is once again the main focus because, as
    is often the case, these products can have significant repercussions for users
    and customers if the products themselves haven’t been thoroughly tested, and if
    the downstream effects of using these products haven’t been studied. While it’s
    always important to get the right idea and a working version of your idea out
    there to test with users, in healthcare use cases, it’s imperative that all areas
    are strongly accounted for because you’re dealing with people’s health and safety.

    I first joined was how communal it was. My prior career was in sales and account
    management, and I took how competitive it was for granted. I was struck by the
    benevolence of the community. There were so many open source projects you could
    get involved in. You could put your projects up on Kaggle and win competitions.
    You could find an almost infinite supply of solutions to problems on Stack Overflow.
    I found a lot of success reaching out to people, who shared their perspectives
    on their area of AI. Never was this more apparent than when I reached out to potential
    speakers to host a panel or a workshop to teach others. It makes this field all
    the more compelling because if you do want to focus on a particular AI solution,
    you can find lots of friends along the way to join your cause and support you.

    use AI for some social or humanitarian cause. Many of them work with other companies,
    schools, governments, and NGOs collaboratively to address certain causes. [AI4Good.org](https://AI4Good.org)
    has worked on smart cities, workforce diversity, AI ethics, and Economists for
    Ukraine projects alongside the United Nations Sustainable development goals. The
    UN itself has the **International Telecommunication Union** (**ITU**), a specialized
    agency for information and communication technologies that has its own AI for
    a good year-round platform to host volunteers and serve their communities as well.
    There are more ecosystems, such as Omdena, DataKind, and Teamcore, that look to
    collaboratively address humanitarian causes as well. Microsoft, [H2O.ai](https://H2O.ai),
    Google, and IBM also have their own AI for Good initiatives.

    that put humanitarianism in their business model, using a combined passion and
    entrepreneurship to bring products to market that also benefit society on some
    level. Companies such as Peat are able to help farmers in insecure areas better
    maximize their yields with their product Plantix. Ad hoc collaborations such as
    the one Lokai made with Facebook to create a pop-up water charity are appearing
    more and more. Sustainable food distribution and urban farming projects are being
    powered by AI, where companies such as Square Roots and Bowery Farming can “*dream
    of a world where agriculture gives back more to the people and planet than* *it
    takes.*”

    of the greatest expressions of AI products we see out there, and we want to remind
    you of the importance of divergent thinking here with regard to ideation. Where
    AI for Good is concerned, we are barely scratching the surface of what AI can
    do, and we would recommend people who enter this realm as product managers focus
    most of their attention on the ideation phase. Practice the use of divergent thinking,
    hone in on the end result you’re looking to achieve with AI, and use this as your
    guide in your ideation phase. Building an MVP will come with its own considerations,
    and you’re already crafting this offering for the benefit of all and combining
    it with a way to create commercial success with your tool, so you can really take
    your time with ideation.

    it’s representative enough of where we’re heading to offer those in AI product
    management a few insights into a few major sectors that shape our world through
    AI. I honestly could go on and on. My hopes were to offer a window to the future
    for the technologists and builders reading this to better conceptualize how AI
    can be leveraged in varying capacities across industries. The strategic side of
    product management requires big-picture thinking. I'm a firm believer in the interconnectivity
    of ideas. One use case in one industry can birth new ideas in another. The elegance
    of tech lies with those that can apply technologies in new, faster, easier, and

    of AI products, and concluded with a glimpse into where AI is going next. *Part

    to understand, ideate, create, and productize AI. We will also explore how AI
    products can be customized and how performance can be optimized, as well as going
