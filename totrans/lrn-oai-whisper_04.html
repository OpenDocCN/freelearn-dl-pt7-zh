			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Fine-Tuning Whisper for Domain and Language Specificity</h1>
			<p>OpenAI’s Whisper represents a groundbreaking innovation in ASR through its ability to transcribe speech into text with unprecedented accuracy. However, as with any machine learning model, Whisper’s out-of-the-box performance still exhibits limitations in niche contexts. For example, during the onset of COVID-19, Whisper could not recognize the term for several months. Similarly, the model needed to accurately transcribe the names of key figures and places associated with the Russia–Ukraine conflict, which required prior <span class="No-Break">training data.</span></p>
			<p>Thus, to fully tap into this model’s potential, we must customize it for specific situations. This chapter will uncover techniques for adapting Whisper’s skills to handle unique business problems. Our adventure will stretch several milestones, from setting up systems to <span class="No-Break">evaluating improvements.</span></p>
			<p>First, we’ll establish and configure Python resources to power our coming work, incorporating datasets/modeling/experimentation libraries that form a solid base on which to build. Next, we’ll smartly pick multilingual speech data sources such as <strong class="bold">Common Voice</strong> to diversify Whisper’s knowledge further for specific niches. More focused data improves the quality <span class="No-Break">of training.</span></p>
			<p>With the stage now set through tools and augmented data, we can tailor Whisper’s predictions to make them ideal for target applications. For example, we’ll explore how adjusting confidence levels, output classes, and time limits can match the expected results in our specific use cases. We’ll also unlock tools for radically fine-tuning Whisper using <span class="No-Break">standard equipment.</span></p>
			<p>Tracking progress relies on straightforward testing. We’ll set up fixed benchmarks to objectively gauge gains in our fine-tuning. Setting high evaluation integrity builds trust in results. We’ll ultimately cycle between improving Whisper and double-checking how sound adaptations transfer into the real world by building and testing a <span class="No-Break">lightweight demo.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll commit to bringing everyone together by fine-tuning low-resource languages rather than inadvertently forgetting groups with <span class="No-Break">fewer advantages.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preparing the environment and data <span class="No-Break">for fine-tuning</span></li>
				<li>Preparing the feature extractor, tokenizer, <span class="No-Break">and data</span></li>
				<li>Training and <span class="No-Break">evaluating metrics</span></li>
				<li>Evaluating performance <span class="No-Break">across datasets</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Through advanced fine-tuning methodologies covered in this chapter and the companion GitHub repository, we will learn the foundational process of fine-tuning Whisper’s performance on industry-specific vocabulary, regional accents, and the integration of real-time learning for unfamiliar emerging terminology. Let’s get started on this <span class="No-Break">hands-on adventure!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, we will leverage Google Colaboratory. We’ll try to secure the best GPU we can afford, with a minimum of 12 GB of <span class="No-Break">GPU memory.</span></p>
			<p>To get a GPU, within Google Colab’s main menu, click <strong class="bold">Runtime</strong> | <strong class="bold">Change runtime type</strong>, then change the <strong class="bold">Hardware accelerator</strong> from <strong class="bold">None</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">GPU</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Keep in mind that fine-tuning Whisper will take several hours. Thus, you must monitor your running notebook in <span class="No-Break">Colab regularly.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter teaches you how to fine-tune the Whisper model so that it can recognize speech in multiple languages using tools such as Hugging Face Datasets, Transformers, and the Hugging Face Hub. Check out the Google Colab Python notebook in this book’s GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-OpenAI-Whisper/tree/main/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-OpenAI-Whisper/tree/main/Chapter04</a>) and try <span class="No-Break">fine-tuning yourself.</span></p>
			<p>The general recommendation is to follow the Colab notebook and upload model checkpoints directly to the Hugging Face Hub while training. The Hub provides <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated version control</strong>: You can be sure that no model checkpoint is lost <span class="No-Break">during training</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TensorBoard logs</strong>: Track important metrics <span class="No-Break">throughout training</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model cards</strong>: Document what a model does and its intended <span class="No-Break">use cases</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Community</strong>: An easy way to share and collaborate with <span class="No-Break">the community!</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Linking the notebook to the Hub is straightforward – you must enter your Hub authentication token when prompted. The Colab notebook has <span class="No-Break">specific instructions.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Introducing the fine-tuning process for Whisper</h1>
			<p>Realizing Whisper’s full potential requires moving beyond out-of-the-box offerings through <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>purposeful fine-tuning – configuring and enhancing the <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>model to capture precise niche needs. This specialized optimization journey traverses nine <span class="No-Break">key milestones:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preparing robust Python environments with essential libraries such as Transformers and datasets that empower <span class="No-Break">rigorous experimentation.</span></li>
				<li>Incorporating diverse, multilingual datasets, including Common Voice, for expanding <span class="No-Break">linguistic breadth.</span></li>
				<li>Setting up Whisper pipeline components such as tokenizers for <span class="No-Break">easier pre/post-processing.</span></li>
				<li>Transforming raw speech data into model-digestible log-Mel <span class="No-Break">spectrogram features.</span></li>
				<li>Defining training parameters and hardware configurations aligned to target <span class="No-Break">model size.</span></li>
				<li>Establishing standardized test sets and metrics for reliable <span class="No-Break">performance benchmarking.</span></li>
				<li>Executing training loops that meld configured hyperparameters, data, <span class="No-Break">and hardware.</span></li>
				<li>Evaluating fine-tuned models against test corpus and <span class="No-Break">benchmark leaderboards.</span></li>
				<li>Building applications demonstrating customized speech <span class="No-Break">recognition efficacy.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The end objective remains as we traverse techniques for enhancing Whisper across these milestones: matching model capabilities to unique production needs through <span class="No-Break">specialized optimization.</span></p>
			<p>With this <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>overview of the fine-tuning process, the next section will cover leveraging Whisper checkpoints. To be clear, Whisper checkpoints <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>are pre-trained models tailored to various computational and linguistic requirements. For our demonstration, we opted for the <strong class="bold">small</strong> checkpoint, owing to its balance between size and performance – offering a practical option for us to efficiently fine-tune Whisper on specialized training data, even with constraints on computational capacity, ensuring that we can still achieve remarkable results in speech recognition for languages not <span class="No-Break">widely spoken.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Leveraging the Whisper checkpoints</h1>
			<p>Whisper <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes (Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, and Large). The checkpoints with the smallest four sizes are trained on either English-only or multilingual data. The largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All 11 pre-trained checkpoints are available on the Hugging Face Hub (<a href="https://huggingface.co/models?search=openai/whisper">https://huggingface.co/models?search=openai/whisper</a>). The checkpoints are summarized in the following table with links to the models on <span class="No-Break">the Hub:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 4.1 – Whisper checkpoints</p>
			<p>We’ll fine-tune <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>the multilingual version of the small checkpoint with 244M params (~= 1 GB) for demonstration purposes. We’ll use a language that’s not widely spoken, taken from the Common Voice dataset, to train and test our system. We’ll demonstrate that we can get good results in this language even with ~=8 hours of specialized <span class="No-Break">training data.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the strategic use of Whisper’s checkpoints, we’ll prepare the environment and data for fine-tuning. This crucial next step invites us to meticulously set up our working environment and curate our data, ensuring our foundation is robust for the fine-tuning process ahead. This transition is guided by the principle of moving from understanding to action, setting the stage for practical application and innovation <span class="No-Break">with Whisper.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Milestone 1 – Preparing the environment and data for fine-tuning</h1>
			<p>Training a <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>cutting-edge speech recognition model such as Whisper poses intense computational demands - specialized hardware configurations are vital for viable fine-tuning. This section demands reasonable programming familiarity – we’ll get our hands dirty with low-level APIs. But fret not if tweaking parameters is not your forte! We will structure explanations and unpack concepts without plunging straight into the depths. You need not actively code along – instead, the insights revealed here seek to empower you to apply these processes for your unique Whisper <span class="No-Break">fine-tuning needs.</span></p>
			<p>If you do <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>crave getting hands-on, this book’s GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-OpenAI-Whisper/tree/main/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-OpenAI-Whisper/tree/main/Chapter04</a> contains a complementary notebook with annotated code blocks aligned to chapter content. Open the notebook and traverse alongside chapters to experiment with parameter tweaking <span class="No-Break">concepts directly.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Leveraging GPU acceleration</h2>
			<p>While Whisper <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>can be trained on CPUs, convergence <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>is prohibitive at around 100 hours, even for tiny <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>checkpoints. Thus, <strong class="bold">GPU acceleration</strong> is critical for feasible <span class="No-Break">iteration cycles.</span></p>
			<p>GPUs provide massively parallel computation, delivering 100x faster training through thousands of processing cores on specialized tensors. Models with over a billion parameters, such as Whisper, particularly benefit from <span class="No-Break">additional throughput.</span></p>
			<p>As we proceed with fine-tuning Whisper, I will use excerpts from the Python notebook available in this book’s GitHub repository. The code listed here is for illustration and explanation purposes. If you want to see the entire code sequence, please refer to the Python notebook for this chapter. The following code excerpt shows how we can track and confirm <span class="No-Break">GPU availability:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())</pre>			<p>Most cloud computing instance types feature attached GPUs – selecting appropriately sized resources <span class="No-Break">is pivotal.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Installing the appropriate Python libraries</h2>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>use a few well-known Python <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>packages to adjust the <span class="No-Break">Whisper model:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">

				<li><strong class="source-inline">gradio</strong> will help us create an impressive demo of our <span class="No-Break">refined model</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ll also <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>link this environment to the Hugging Face Hub so <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>that we can easily share fine-tuned models with <span class="No-Break">the community:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
notebook_login()</pre>			<p>Hugging Face provides version control, model documentation, and public access, thus ensuring full reproducibility while allowing us to build on each <span class="No-Break">other’s work.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Hugging Face and Whisper</p>
			<p class="callout">Hugging Face is <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>a data science company that provides a platform for sharing and collaborating on machine learning models, particularly NLP. It is widely recognized for its Transformers library, which offers a collection of pre-trained models and tools for various NLP tasks, including text classification, translation, summarization, and, pertinent to our <span class="No-Break">discussion, ASR.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Hugging Face provides a streamlined process for fine-tuning Whisper. It allows you to load and prepare your training data, execute the data preparation and fine-tuning steps, and evaluate your model’s performance. It also offers integrated version control, TensorBoard logs, model cards, and a community for sharing <span class="No-Break">and collaboration.</span></p>
			<p>While Whisper already knows a lot about many languages, there’s room to grow – especially when <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>handling specific situations such as niche vocabulary. We’ll walk through methods for bringing in complementary speech data to fill <span class="No-Break">those gaps.</span></p>
			<p>The Common Voice project led by Mozilla is an ideal fit here, with its 100+ languages sourced straight from global volunteers. We’ll cover easy ways to tap into these crowd-sourced datasets to balance Whisper’s accuracy and inclusiveness for niche <span class="No-Break">international uses.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond Common Voice, we can create custom mixes from multiple datasets worldwide to test Whisper’s boundaries. Clever blending stresses flexibility, which is vital for commercial success. But we can’t just pursue giant datasets – diversity brings resilience. We’ll equip ourselves with best practices for construction representatives and varied combinations tailored to deployment needs <span class="No-Break">across languages.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s get started by plugging some Common Voice data <span class="No-Break">into Whisper.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Milestone 2 – Incorporating the Common Voice 11 dataset</h1>
			<p>The Common Voice dataset, spearheaded by Mozilla, represents a pioneering effort in democratizing <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>speech technology through open and diverse speech corpora. A <strong class="bold">dataset</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>structured collection of data where the rows typically represent individual observations or instances, and the columns represent the features or variables of those instances. In the case of Common Voice, each row represents an audio record, and each column represents features or characteristics applicable to the audio record. As an ever-expanding, community-driven initiative across 100+ languages, Common Voice optimally augments multilingual speech recognition systems <span class="No-Break">like Whisper.</span></p>
			<p>Integrating Common Voice data is straightforward with the Hugging Face <strong class="source-inline">Datasets</strong> library. We load the desired language split in streaming mode to bypass extensive storage requirements and expedite <span class="No-Break">fine-tuning workflows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict
common_voice = DatasetDict()
common_voice["train"] = load_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0", "hi", split="train+validation", use_auth_token=True)
common_voice["test"] = load_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0", "hi", split="test", use_auth_token=True)
print(common_voice)</pre>			<p>When we initially loaded the Common Voice dataset, it came with much extra information, such as the speaker’s accent, gender, age, and more. It also included the path to the disk audio file, IDs, and votes for data <span class="No-Break">quality assurance.</span></p>
			<p>But we don’t care about those extra metadata details for speech recognition using Whisper. The only data Whisper needs to predict is the audio itself and the matching text transcript. Everything else is unnecessary for <span class="No-Break">our purposes.</span></p>
			<p>So, this line of <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>code creates a trimmed-down version of the Common Voice dataset by removing those extra columns or features irrelevant to our speech recognition task. We pare it down to just the essential <em class="italic">audio</em> and <em class="italic">sentence</em> text that Whisper requires. This simplifies the <span class="No-Break">data pipeline:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
common_voice = common_voice.remove_columns(["accent", "age", "client_id", "down_votes", "gender", "locale", "path", "segment", "up_votes"])</pre>			<p>By stripping away unrelated metadata, we ensure that only meaningful features get fed into Whisper. This helps the model focus on learning speech-to-text mappings rather than irrelevant patterns from speaker details. The result is a cleaner dataset that is more tightly aligned with our <span class="No-Break">end goals.</span></p>
			<p>Common Voice encapsulates notable domain diversity, recording conditions, and speaker demographics. These datasets exhibit substantial audio quality and accent variability as crowd-sourced collections from global contributors. The presence of real-world recording imperfections makes Common Voice a challenging benchmark for assessing <span class="No-Break">model robustness.</span></p>
			<p>While expansive diversity poses difficulties, it also enables more resilient speech recognition. Systems trained exclusively on pristine corpora such as LibriSpeech falter when applied to noisy environments. Heterogeneous data that integrates noise is thus imperative for <span class="No-Break">production-ready performance.</span></p>
			<p>By covering data diversity, Common Voice complements Whisper’s foundations. The model’s extensive multilingual pre-training provides comprehensive linguistic coverage; adapting this knowledge to Common Voice’s variability and low-resource languages is an optimal direction for bespoke <span class="No-Break">enterprise applications.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, call centers handling customer inquiries require ASR resilient to accents, recording artifacts, and domain lexicon. Contact center analytics currently needs help with niche terminology. Contact center agents discuss specialized concepts, from telecom acronyms such as CDMA/GSM to named entities such as iPhone 14 Pro Max. Enhancing Whisper’s contextual mastery necessitates domain-specific data. Contact centers have a <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>particular lexicon – the model must understand that specific lexicon. The model will learn the specifics of that industry by having in-domain data. So, fine-tuning Whisper on Common Voice call center recordings would boost its contact <span class="No-Break">center efficacy.</span></p>
			<p>Besides domain optimization, multilingual support remains imperative for global businesses. While Whisper demonstrates impressive zero-shot cross-lingual ability, adapting acoustic and linguistic knowledge to under-represented languages is vital for <span class="No-Break">equitable AI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Expanding language coverage</h2>
			<p>While Whisper’s multilingual design provides comprehensive linguistic coverage, enhancing <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>performance in low-resource languages remains an ethical imperative for inclusive speech technology. Strategically fine-tuning targeted language data is critical for equitable <span class="No-Break">global deployment.</span></p>
			<p>The Common <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>Voice project shares these motivations for multilingual representation. The initiative provides datasets for over 100 languages, including many under-resourced tongues. This presents a unique opportunity to augment Whisper’s knowledge in languages needing more <span class="No-Break">training data.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, the Lithuanian subset contains approximately 50 hours of labeled speech. Building an automated Lithuanian transcriber from scratch is infeasible for agile Baltic startups. However, by leveraging Whisper’s transfer learning capabilities, you can rapidly construct a performant Lithuania-optimized system <span class="No-Break">through fine-tuning.</span></p>
			<p>The implications are profound for enterprises in lower-income regions often underserved by AI. Rather than building costly customized models, adapting Whisper alleviates economic barriers to speech <span class="No-Break">technology access.</span></p>
			<p>Constructively integrating these datasets presents a means of propagating social good through language technology. Strategic incorporation must balance accuracy, speed, and inclusion. While augmenting with all 100+ Common Voice languages maximizes coverage, convergence would be prohibitive for most applications. We must be selective. For global enterprises, carefully selecting ~10 diverse languages for enhancement ensures sustainable commercial viability without excluding <span class="No-Break">underserved communities.</span></p>
			<p>This strategic <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>balancing act permeates <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>all forms of algorithmic bias mitigation. Prejudicial solutions, such as intentionally hampering performance in specific languages, should be avoided. Instead, we can proactively improve technologies for excluded groups through targeted data augmentation. Common Voice provides the data resources to achieve <span class="No-Break">this sustainably.</span></p>

			<p>Speech translation entails significant complexity – systems must map acoustic signals to not just text <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>but also text in another language. This task <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>requires multifaceted model capabilities, from source language comprehension to target <span class="No-Break">language fluency.</span></p>
			<p>Whisper’s architecture provides strong foundations, integrating an encoder-decoder structure with deep attentional fusion between audio semantics and language generation. However, no organization alone can keep up with the continuous evolution of diverse acoustic environments and <span class="No-Break">low-resource languages.</span></p>
			<p>Mozilla’s Common Voice project members are constructing accessible multilingual corpora. The project’s upcoming 12th edition will include speech translation data pairs in 50 languages to further democratization efforts. Integrating these datasets can optimize Whisper for production translation <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, call centers again represent a compelling but challenging application area. Agents must handle customer inquiries globally across different languages – training models exclusively on individual high-resource language risks, excluding underrepresented tongues <span class="No-Break">and accents.</span></p>
			<p>So, constructively balancing languages is crucial for ethical deployment. Achieving parity requires the strategic incorporation of diverse linguistic data. Sources such as Common Voice, through crowdsourced global recordings, provide microcosms of real-world language variability. Models trained on these datasets learn to parse multifaceted accents and <span class="No-Break">speech cadences.</span></p>
			<p>Progress in automatic speech translation has accelerated recently through self-supervised techniques. Models such as XLSR-Wav2vec2, pre-trained on 56k hours of Common <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>Voice data across 50 languages, have created breakthroughs in direct <span class="No-Break">speech-to-speech translation.</span></p>
			<p>With our <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>newfound strategies for enhancing Whisper’s translation capabilities, we’ll embark on setting up Whisper pipeline components. This shift in focus lays the groundwork for a more granular examination of the tools and processes integral to Whisper’s ASR workflow. By delving into the setup of Whisper’s pipeline components, we’re preparing to fine-tune our approach, ensuring our project’s success with a solid, <span class="No-Break">practical foundation.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Milestone 3 – Setting up Whisper pipeline components</h1>
			<p>The process <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>of ASR can be broken down into three <span class="No-Break">main parts:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature extractor</strong>: This is the initial step of processing the raw audio inputs. Think of <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>it as preparing the audio files, so the model can easily understand and use them. The feature extractor turns the audio into a format that highlights essential aspects of the sound, such as pitch or volume, which are crucial for the model to recognize different words <span class="No-Break">and sounds.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The model</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>core part of the ASR process. It performs what we call sequence-to-sequence mapping. In simpler terms, it takes the processed audio from the feature extractor and works to convert it into a sequence of text. It’s like translating the language of sounds into the language <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>of text. This part involves complex calculations and patterns to accurately determine what the <span class="No-Break">audio says.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tokenizer</strong>: After the model has done its job of mapping the sounds to text, the tokenizer <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>steps in. It post-processes the model’s outputs and formats them into readable text. It’s like giving the final touch to the translation, ensuring that it makes sense in text form and follows the rules of the language, such as proper spacing <span class="No-Break">and punctuation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In Hugging Face Transformers, a popular toolkit for handling NLP tasks, such as text classification, language translation, and speech recognition, the Whisper model has a feature extractor and a tokenizer, aptly named <em class="italic">WhisperFeatureExtractor</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">WhisperTokenizer</em></span><span class="No-Break">, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>We will look deeper into the feature extractor and tokenizer specifics separately. Understanding these components is critical as each plays a vital role in converting spoken words <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>into written text. We’ll explore how the feature extractor fine-tunes the raw audio for the model and how the tokenizer ensures the output text is accurate and coherent. This detailed look will give you a clearer picture of how the Whisper model processes speech, turning the complex task of speech recognition into a streamlined, <span class="No-Break">efficient process.</span></p>
			<p>We will return to the <em class="italic">WhisperFeatureExtractor</em>. For now, let’s first understand the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">WhisperTokenizer</em></span><span class="No-Break"> component.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Loading WhisperTokenizer</h2>
			<p>The Whisper <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>tokenizer helps translate text token sequences (numbers) into actual readable text. For example, it can turn a sequence such as [1169, 3797, 3332] into the sentence “the <span class="No-Break">cat sat.”</span></p>
			<p>In traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>speech recognition models, we use a method called <strong class="bold">connectionist temporal classification</strong> (<strong class="bold">CTC</strong>) to decode speech, and a specific CTC tokenizer is needed for each dataset. However, the Whisper model, which uses a different architecture (encoder-decoder), lets us use its pre-trained <span class="No-Break">tokenizer directly.</span></p>
			<p>This Whisper tokenizer has been trained in many languages, making it suitable for almost any multilingual speech recognition task. For instance, if you’re working with Hindi, you can load the Whisper tokenizer without any changes. You need to specify the language you’re working with (for example, Hindi) and the task (for example, transcription). This tells the tokenizer to add particular language and task tokens at the beginning of the sequences <span class="No-Break">it processes.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example of how to load the Whisper tokenizer <span class="No-Break">for Hindi:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from transformers import WhisperTokenizer
tokenizer = WhisperTokenizer.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-small", language="Hindi", task="transcribe")</pre>			<p>You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>adapt this for speech translation by changing the task to <strong class="source-inline">translate</strong> and setting the language to your target language. This will ensure that the tokenizer adds the proper tokens for <span class="No-Break">translating speech.</span></p>
			<p>To check that the tokenizer works correctly with Hindi, test it on a sample from the Common Voice dataset. Of course, this does not necessarily mean the tokenizer can recognize the meaning of the text. Instead, it translates sequences of text tokens (numbers) into actual readable text indicating the language and other features. When encoding speech, the tokenizer adds <em class="italic">special tokens</em> at the beginning and end, such as tokens for the start/end of the transcript, language, and task. You can ignore these unique tokens when decoding to regain a clean, original text string. This ensures that the tokenizer can accurately handle the Hindi language in speech recognition tasks. The following Python snippet demonstrates a basic workflow for processing speech data for speech recognition tasks using a tokenizer – in this case, within the context of the Common Voice <span class="No-Break">11 dataset:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
input_str = common_voice["train"][0]["sentence"]
labels = tokenizer(input_str).input_ids
decoded_with_special = tokenizer.decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=False)
decoded_str = tokenizer.decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Input:                 {input_str}")
print(f"Decoded w/ special:    {decoded_with_special}")
print(f"Decoded w/out special: {decoded_str}")
print(f"Are equal:             {input_str == decoded_str}")</pre>			<p>Here’s a <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>high-level explanation of <span class="No-Break">each step:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extract the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">input sentence</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><pre class="source-code">
input_str = common_voice["train"][0]["sentence"]</pre><p class="list-inset">This line retrieves the first sentence from the training set of the Common Voice 11 dataset. <strong class="source-inline">common_voice["train"][0]["sentence"]</strong> is a dictionary access pattern where <strong class="source-inline">"train"</strong> indicates the subset of the dataset (training data in this case), <strong class="source-inline">[0]</strong> selects the first record, and <strong class="source-inline">["sentence"]</strong> extracts the sentence text. We want to process this sentence for <span class="No-Break">speech recognition.</span></p></li>				<li><strong class="bold">Tokenize the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">input sentence</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><pre class="source-code">
labels = tokenizer(input_str).input_ids</pre><p class="list-inset">The tokenizer converts the input string into a sequence of tokens.

This step is crucial for preparing text data for processing with neural networks as they require <span class="No-Break">numerical input.</span></p></li>				<li><strong class="bold">Decode the tokens (with and without </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">special tokens)</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><pre class="source-code">

It’s a simple way to verify that the tokenizer can accurately reproduce the original sentence after converting it into tokens and back, minus any special tokens used <span class="No-Break">for processing.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This snippet <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>illustrates how text data is prepared and handled in the context of speech recognition and processing with the Common Voice 11 dataset. Such a process is part of a larger pipeline that might include converting audio into text, processing the text for training or inference with machine learning models, and evaluating the models’ performance in tasks such as ASR. Understanding the role of tokenizers is essential as they bridge the gap between raw text data and the numerical formats required for effective model training <span class="No-Break">and operation.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the print output you will see after the previous snippet <span class="No-Break">is ran:</span></p>

Are equal:             True</pre>			<p>Equipped with a better understanding of the purpose and capabilities of the <em class="italic">WhisperTokenizer</em>, let’s explore the <em class="italic">WhisperFeatureExtractor</em> in the <span class="No-Break">next milestone.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Milestone 4 – Transforming raw speech data into Mel spectrogram features</h1>
			<p>Speech can be considered a one-dimensional array that changes over time, with each point in <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>the array representing the loudness or amplitude of the sound. To understand speech, we need to capture its frequency and acoustic features, which can be done by analyzing <span class="No-Break">the amplitude.</span></p>
			<p>However, speech is a continuous sound stream, and computers can’t handle infinite data. So, we must convert this continuous stream into a series of discrete values by sampling the speech at regular intervals. This sampling is measured in samples per second or Hertz (Hz). The higher the sampling rate, the more accurately it captures the speech, but it also means more data to store <span class="No-Break">every second.</span></p>
			<p>It’s important to ensure that the sampling rate of the audio matches what the speech recognition model expects. If the rates don’t match, it can lead to errors. For example, playing a sound sampled at 16 kHz at 8 kHz will make it sound slower. The Whisper model, for instance, expects a sampling rate of 16 kHz, so we need to ensure our audio matches this rate. Otherwise, we might train the model on distorted audio, such as <span class="No-Break">slow-motion speech.</span></p>
			<p>The Whisper feature extractor, a tool used in speech recognition, does two things with audio samples. First, it makes sure all audio samples are precisely 30 seconds long. If a sample is shorter, it adds silence to the end to reach 30 seconds. If it’s longer, it cuts it down to 30 seconds. This means we don’t need an attention mask for the Whisper model, which is unique. Usually, in audio models, you need an attention mask to show where you’ve added silence, but Whisper can figure it <span class="No-Break">out itself.</span></p>
			<p>The second <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>thing the Whisper feature extractor does is turn these adjusted audio samples into <strong class="bold">log-Mel</strong> spectrograms. These are visual charts showing the frequencies in the sound over time, where different colors represent different intensities of frequencies. The Whisper model uses these charts to understand and process speech. They’re designed to mimic how humans hear, focusing on specific frequencies that are more important for <span class="No-Break">understanding speech.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, ensuring your audio samples are at the proper sampling rate (16 kHz for Whisper) is crucial when working with speech recognition and the Whisper model. The feature extractor then standardizes these samples to 30 seconds each by adding silence or cutting excess. Finally, it converts these samples into log-Mel spectrograms, visual representations of sound frequencies, which the Whisper model uses to recognize and process speech. These steps are essential for accurate <span class="No-Break">speech recognition.</span></p>
			<p>Luckily, the Hugging Face Transformers Whisper feature extractor performs the padding and <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>spectrogram conversion in just one line of code! Let’s go ahead and load the feature extractor from the pre-trained checkpoint to have it ready for our <span class="No-Break">audio data:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from transformers import WhisperFeatureExtractor
feature_extractor = WhisperFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-small")</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Combining to create a WhisperProcessor class</h2>
			<p>To make it easier to work with the feature extractor and tokenizer, we can combine them <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>into a single class called <strong class="source-inline">WhisperProcessor</strong>. This processor <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>acts like both <strong class="source-inline">WhisperFeatureExtractor</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">WhisperTokenizer</strong>. It can be used on audio inputs and model predictions as needed. This way, during training, we only need to focus on two main components: the <em class="italic">processor</em> and the <em class="italic">model</em>. The following Python snippet illustrates how to initialize <strong class="source-inline">WhisperProcessor</strong> for the <strong class="source-inline">openai/whisper-small</strong> model, explicitly configured for transcribing Hindi <span class="No-Break">language audio:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>We’ll change <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>the audio to the proper sampling rate using the dataset’s <strong class="source-inline">cast_column</strong> method. It applies transformations to the data in a given column, such as resampling the audio data to a different sampling rate. It is beneficial when working with audio datasets in machine learning tasks.

			<pre class="source-code">
def prepare_dataset(batch):

				<li>Convert the transcripts into label IDs using <span class="No-Break">the tokenizer.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>we have the <strong class="source-inline">prepare_dataset()</strong> function defined, we can apply this data preparation function to all our training examples using the dataset’s <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">map</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> method:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The datasets currently use both <strong class="source-inline">torchaudio</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">librosa</strong> for audio handling.

			<p>As we culminate our exploration of synthesizing <strong class="source-inline">WhisperProcessor</strong>, merging the feature extractor and tokenizer into a unified workflow, we transition toward defining training parameters and hardware configurations. This crucial juncture signifies our preparation for the intricate task of fine-tuning, emphasizing the strategic selection of training parameters and hardware configurations that align with our learning project’s scale <span class="No-Break">and complexity.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Milestone 5 – Defining training parameters and hardware configurations</h1>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>our data is ready, we can start training our model. We’ll use <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>the Hugging Face Trainer to help with most of the work. The Hugging Face <strong class="source-inline">Trainer</strong> class provides a feature-complete training and evaluation loop for PyTorch models optimized for Transformers. It supports distributed training on multiple GPUs/TPUs and mixed precision and offers a lot of customizability for users. The <strong class="source-inline">Trainer</strong> class abstracts away the complexities of the training loop, allowing users to focus on providing the essential components required for training, such as a model and a dataset. Here’s what we need <span class="No-Break">to do:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Set up a data collator</strong>: This tool takes our prepared data into PyTorch tensors that the model <span class="No-Break">can use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Choose evaluation metrics</strong>: We want to see how well the model performs using the <strong class="bold">word error rate</strong> (<strong class="bold">WER</strong>) metric. To perform this calculation, we’ll create a function <span class="No-Break">called compute_metrics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Load a pre-trained model</strong>: We’ll start with an already-trained model and set it up for further training. Training Whisper from scratch is not an option due to the intense data and computing resources required for such <span class="No-Break">a task.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define training arguments</strong>: These arguments guide the Hugging Face Trainer on how to train <span class="No-Break">the model.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>fine-tuning the model, we’ll test it on new data to <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>ensure it can accurately transcribe speech <span class="No-Break">in Hindi.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Setting up the data collator</h2>
			<p>The data collator <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>for speech models like ours is a bit special. It handles <em class="italic">input features</em> and <em class="italic">labels</em> separately: the feature extractor manages the<em class="italic"> input features</em>, whereas the tokenizer manages <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">labels</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The input features are set to 30 seconds and have been turned into a fixed-size log-Mel spectrogram. We just need to convert them into grouped <em class="italic">PyTorch tensors</em>. We can do this using the feature extractor’s <strong class="source-inline">self.processor.tokenizer.pad</strong> method with <strong class="source-inline">return_tensors="pt"</strong>. Since the input features are already fixed in size, we’re just changing them into <em class="italic">PyTorch tensors</em> without adding <span class="No-Break">extra padding.</span></p>
			<p>The labels, however, still need to be padded. First, we must pad them to the longest length in our batch using the <strong class="source-inline">self.processor.tokenizer.pad</strong> method. We are replacing the padding tokens with <strong class="source-inline">-100</strong> so they don’t affect the loss calculation. We must also remove the start of the transcript token from the beginning of the label sequence, as we’ll add it back <span class="No-Break">during training.</span></p>
			<p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>use the <strong class="source-inline">WhisperProcessor</strong> class we made earlier to handle the feature extractor and <span class="No-Break">tokenizer tasks:</span></p>

Here’s an example of how to load <span class="No-Break">the model:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from transformers import WhisperForConditionalGeneration, WhisperProcessor
model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("jbatista79/whisper-small-hi")
processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("jbatista79/whisper-small-hi")</pre>			<p>While the <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>model we’ve fine-tuned works well with the Common Voice Hindi test data, it’s not perfect. This guide is meant to show you how to fine-tune pre-trained Whisper models on any speech recognition dataset in multiple languages. You might get even better results by tweaking the training settings, such as learning rate and dropout, or using a bigger pre-trained model (such as the medium or <span class="No-Break">large versions).</span></p>
			<p>With the optimized training process complete and our fine-tuned model uploaded, we’ll now transition to assessing the real-world efficacy of our enhanced speech recognition capabilities. We will validate how our tailored Whisper model generalizes across languages, domains, and acoustic environments by benchmarking performance across <span class="No-Break">diverse datasets.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Milestone 8 – Evaluating performance across datasets</h1>
			<p>As we conclude <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>our Whisper fine-tuning journey, validating model performance across diverse real-world conditions represents a pivotal final milestone. Before deploying our optimized speech recognizer into production scenarios, comprehensively assessing its effectiveness across datasets, languages, accents, and acoustic environments is essential for instilling confidence. This testing phase unveils actual capabilities, revealing where additional tuning may be required while spotlighting areas suitable for immediate application. The rigorous evaluation processes outlined in this section aim to verify customized performance gains while guiding <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>ethical and inclusive rollout by covering key facets such as bias mitigation, domain optimization, translation abilities, and <span class="No-Break">expectation management.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Mitigating demographic biases</h2>
			<p>Machine learning models, including those for speech recognition, can sometimes detect biases against certain genders, ethnicities, or age groups. This happens because the audio data <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>they learn from can vary greatly between different groups of people. To prevent this, we must train the model with a wide range of data and use unique methods to check <span class="No-Break">for biases.</span></p>
			<p>We should <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>carefully examine where the model might work better for certain groups of people. This will help us understand which groups might need more support from the model. We can also change the data the model learns from to see if it treats different groups of people differently. This will help us find the real reasons for <span class="No-Break">any unfairness.</span></p>
			<p>Finding problems is not enough. We also need to add a variety of data to the model. This means getting data from many different sources, especially those that haven’t been included much before. We can use methods such as web scraping to find new kinds of speech data. We can also create artificial voices, but we must be careful and transparent about how we <span class="No-Break">do this.</span></p>
			<p>We need to be careful to avoid overcorrecting and creating new problems. Our goal is to improve the model for everyone. We can do this by testing it equally with different groups of people to ensure it works well <span class="No-Break">for everyone.</span></p>
			<p>We should aim to use language technology to unite people, not separate them. We should focus on making speech technology that is fair and helpful for everyone. This means constantly checking and improving our models to ensure they are fair and helpful for all different groups <span class="No-Break">of people.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Optimizing for content domains</h2>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>Whisper’s extensive pre-training provides broad linguistic <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>capabilities, tailoring its knowledge toward specialized domains is pivotal for competitive enterprise use cases. Contact centers, legal firms, finance brokers, telemedicine providers—speech recognition permeates diverse industries, each carrying distinct challenges. Beyond vocabulary, accurately modeling nonverbal cues, discourse patterns, and subtle connotations underpins contextual understanding in <span class="No-Break">niche domains.</span></p>
			<p>Yet out-of-the-box ASR systems often stumble on niche terminology and struggle to convey implicitly layered meaning. For example, a precise understanding of clauses has substantive significance in legal contexts. Models trained exclusively on generic datasets fail to distill these specialized connotations. Exposing systems to targeted in-domain data is thus vital for infusing <span class="No-Break">contextual mastery.</span></p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>nucleus of domain optimization <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>lies in terminology mastery. Legal, medical, and financial contexts involve extensive exotic lexicons that shape substantive task competencies. Yet glossaries alone fail to encapsulate the layered semantics encoded in <span class="No-Break">specialist dictionaries.</span></p>
			<p>One option is <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>to employ <strong class="bold">explicit semantic analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">ESA</strong>), a computational method for mathematically representing human notions of language meaning. ESA is a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from a large text corpus, and it is used in NLP and <span class="No-Break">information retrieval.</span></p>
			<p>In simple terms, ESA is a way for computers to understand the meaning of a piece of text by comparing it to a large amount of text data it has already analyzed. It does this by mapping the text to a set of concepts or topics derived from a large corpus of text data. This mapping is done in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a different concept <span class="No-Break">or topic.</span></p>
			<p>For example, if the text is about “dogs,” ESA might map it to concepts such as “animals,” “pets,” “canines,” and so on. By doing this, ESA can understand the semantic meaning of the text, which can be used for tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, and more. ESA is beneficial because it can capture the meaning of text even when the words used are not the same. For instance, it can be understood that “dogs” and “canines” refer to the same concept, even though the words are different. This makes it a powerful tool for understanding and processing <span class="No-Break">natural language.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Managing user expectations</h2>
			<p>Responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>use of AI speech recognition technology involves <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>ensuring users understand what the technology can and cannot do. It’s essential to be open about the technology’s capabilities and limits so that people can make informed choices about using it. This is especially crucial for those who might not have much <span class="No-Break">digital experience.</span></p>
			<p>Effective communication about technology’s abilities helps build trust. This can be done through easy-to-understand summaries and explanations that address specific user needs without overwhelming them with too much detail. Tools such as model confidence scores and visualizations can help users gauge the reliability of the technology’s predictions, making it more transparent when and how it’s <span class="No-Break">best used.</span></p>
			<p>Being upfront about what technology can’t do is just as important. Recognizing limitations is not a sign of failure; it’s an opportunity for growth and improvement. For example, areas where Whisper might struggle, such as real-time recognition in noisy environments, should be seen as challenges to be solved through collaborative effort rather than <span class="No-Break">permanent flaws.</span></p>
			<p>Listening <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>to users and incorporating their feedback is critical <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>to improving speech recognition technology for everyone. Regularly checking how the technology performs in real-world situations helps prevent it from drifting away from users’ needs. By involving users in the process via humans-in-the-loop, we can focus on addressing the most pressing issues and make improvements <span class="No-Break">more efficiently.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Milestone 9 – Building applications that demonstrate customized speech recognition</h1>
			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>that our model has been fine-tuned let’s demonstrate how good it is at speech recognition (ASR)! We’ll use the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline to handle everything, from preparing the audio to decoding <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>what the model thinks the audio says.
