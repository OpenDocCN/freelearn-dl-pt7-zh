    data at scale to provide context for new products.

    AI fueled by product data can uncover what features and attributes your competitors
    are already providing to consumers. These insights can help you ensure that your
    next product release doesn't overlap with an existing one. This enables you to
    enter new product markets with more competitive differentiation. It can also extract
    patterns and trends from the data to help you understand what consumers want and
    need.

    accessories and sell a cell phone charger. As seen in *Figure 9.2*, we can view
    an AI-generated feed of leading brands and products in this area. In particular,
    **Anker** is the brand, and its three main strengths are that it's *fast*, it
    holds a *long charge*, and it's *durable*. Therefore, we know that to compete
    with Anker, those are the top attributes that we'd have to provide to consumers
    as well.

    that is small enough to fit in my pocket*. This generated idea makes sense, as
    typical chargers are often very bulky and inconvenient. Perhaps a product team
    will go along with this idea, or perhaps it will spur another idea for a different

    In other words, product managers assumed that the best way to understand their
    customers was to spend time with them. This approach has evolved quite a bit over
    the past few decades. The trend now is toward more data-driven approaches to product
    management.

    software to automate repetitive tasks seemed like a no-brainer and something every
    company needed to be doing if they wanted to stay competitive in an increasingly
    fast-paced business environment.
  prefs: []

    along the way. This also means freeing up valuable resources for other initiatives

    doesn't always work, and it has its limitations. However, when used properly,
    AI can provide invaluable insights into customer behavior that can help companies
    make informed decisions about product launches while reducing risk along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of approach is called **pro-active demand analysis** because it uses
    machine learning techniques to predict demand before it arises (rather than reactively,
    during times when sales are slow or zero). By doing so, companies can also ensure
    that they have enough inventory on hand to meet peak demand after a product launch—which
    could result in lost sales if an item isn't restocked quickly enough.
  prefs: []

    plays a role should be improved with AI capabilities. After all, most commerce
    businesses need to constantly replenish the stock of any given SKU.

    to a select group of people who have been handpicked by you, the company. The
    goal here is to gauge customer reactions and measure **customer acquisition costs**
    (**CACs**). In other words, you are testing out your product or service to determine
    how much it will cost to acquire customers, and then adjusting your launch strategy
    accordingly.

    insights. As a brand manager, you can use machine learning and NLP to identify
    the types of data that will be most relevant to your particular business objectives,
    and then you can automate the collection and processing of this type of data as
    part of an ongoing effort to stay abreast of your target market.

    the quickest win you can get from AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    instance, if you're a retailer, applying AI to product selection could mean identifying
    bestsellers among similar items (for example, which sneakers/boots are selling
    well?) and using **A/B testing** or other tools to determine what specific attributes
    of those products make them *sticky*, and pushing more of those kinds of items
    onto shoppers while curating less popular items off the site altogether.

    respectively. The control group is the original, while the treatment group receives
    a specific change. Suppose you were testing a new pair of sneakers on **Amazon**.
    You might change the default color from black to red or raise the price by 10%.
    You'd then measure how many people click on that specific item, compared to how
    many clicked on the original sneakers.

    establishing credibility and trust. It's how you tell people what your product
    or service can do for them. When it comes to ad copy, it's all about the benefits
    you communicate in an effort to unlock the value of your offering through different
    channels (AdWords being one example).

    description is how you tell people about the product and why they need it. It's
    a means to help people understand what your product can do for them and how it
    will benefit their lives. The key here is to communicate the benefits of your
    offering in terms that are relevant to your target audience so that they can understand
    its value proposition.

    your product or service before they buy it. It's all about making sure that the
    package itself conveys the right message so that when someone opens up the box
    or unwraps the item, they get a sense of what you want them to feel or experience
    with your product. This helps create an emotional connection between you and your
    customer so that when they make a purchase decision, they choose to buy from you
    instead of someone else.

    makes you different from everyone else out there, and why someone should choose
    to do business with you over another company or option available. And if done
    right, this will result in more conversions (people buying).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step in writing effective ad copy is understanding who exactly will
    be reading it (the person who sees it on social media or elsewhere) and what their
    motivations might be for doing so. Once we know this information, we can start
    crafting our ad copy around these insights in order to ensure that our message
    resonates with our intended audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second step in writing effective ad copy is defining the core benefit or
    promise of your product or service so that you can communicate this directly to
    your intended audience. This is where we start crafting our message around the
    benefits that your offering provides for people's lives so that they understand
    why they should choose you over someone else.
  prefs: []

    how product teams can use AI for customer support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of product development. Customer support is about helping your users solve problems
    with your product or service. It's about anticipating issues before they happen
    and providing actionable advice when they do. It's about understanding what makes
    people tick so you can anticipate their needs and provide them with the right
    information at the right time. And it's about proactively addressing non-issues
    so that people don't have to call you for help in the first place!

    and anticipating their needs so you can provide them with relevant information
    at just the right time, whether that''s during their use of your product or service

    campaigns, partnerships, and more, but data alone isn't enough—it must be actionable
    data that helps drive results for the business. Data without insight is noise;
    insight without action is blind speculation; action without accountability leads

    process? The answer lies in applying critical thinking skills to the data. When
    you apply critical thinking skills to your data, you're able to see patterns and
    draw inferences that can lead to insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With critical thinking, you start to understand what is happening in your product
    or service, why it's happening, and what you can do about it. This requires a
    shift from purely analytical thinking (which focuses on the numbers and metrics)
    toward a more holistic approach that considers context and **user experience**
    (**UX**).By applying critical thinking skills to your data, you're able to see
    patterns and draw inferences that can lead to insights.
