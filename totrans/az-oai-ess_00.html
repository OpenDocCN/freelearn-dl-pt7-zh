			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to work on transformative technologies that redefine the way businesses operate and innovate. Among these, <strong class="bold">generative artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">GenAI</strong>) stands out as a groundbreaking advancement, capable of reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace. The excitement surrounding GenAI is palpable, with organizations across the globe racing to understand its potential and implement it effectively. Yet, for many, the journey from curiosity to implementation is fraught with complexity <span class="No-Break">and uncertainty.</span></p>
			<p>In our professional journey at Microsoft, we have collaborated with diverse teams, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 healthcare companies, to explore and deploy AI-driven solutions. This experience has revealed a recurring theme: while the promise of GenAI is immense, there is a significant knowledge gap in bridging conceptual understanding with practical application. Organizations often struggle to navigate this rapidly evolving field, seeking actionable insights to turn vision <span class="No-Break">into reality.</span></p>
			<p>This book is our attempt to address that gap. It serves as a comprehensive guide to Azure OpenAI, a leading platform in the GenAI landscape, blending foundational knowledge with hands-on techniques. Whether you are a developer, data scientist, or decision-maker, the book is designed to help you understand the potential of Azure OpenAI, integrate it into your workflows, and unlock its <span class="No-Break">full capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Throughout the book, we take you on a journey from the basics of generative AI and <strong class="bold">large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) to advanced topics such as operationalization, privacy, security, and prompt engineering. Real-world examples and step-by-step guides are woven into the narrative, ensuring that you gain not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills to implement Azure OpenAI <span class="No-Break">solutions effectively.</span></p>
			<p>One of the unique aspects of this field is its rapid evolution. While writing this book, I witnessed new advancements emerge within weeks, requiring constant updates to reflect the state of the art. Despite these changes, the core principles of GenAI and LLMs remain essential, forming the foundation upon which the next wave of innovation <span class="No-Break">is built.</span></p>
			<p>The examples and use cases in this book primarily utilize Azure OpenAI, given its enterprise-ready capabilities and seamless integration with Azure services. However, the concepts and techniques are transferable to other platforms, ensuring relevance regardless of your chosen provider. Python is used for implementation examples, offering a simple yet powerful way to interact with <span class="No-Break">AI models.</span></p>
			<p>Welcome to this journey of exploring Azure OpenAI Essentials. This book aims to empower you with the knowledge and confidence to harness the power of GenAI in your projects. I hope it serves as both an inspiration and a practical resource as you venture into this <span class="No-Break">transformative domain.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s build the <span class="No-Break">future together!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
