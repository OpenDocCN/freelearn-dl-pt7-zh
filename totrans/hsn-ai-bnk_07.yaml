    concepts. We looked at how AI can help us in optimizing the best capital structure
    by running risk models and generating sales forecasts using macro-economic data.
    We also looked at how useful AI is while planning the financial internals of an
    organization and external investors' communication. We then looked at two examples
    – the first regarding how to optimize the funding mix of debt and equity and the
    second regarding performing a financial forecast that could help us with financially
    planning capital demand.

    issues so that the capital can be obtained from the interested investors. Then,
    you will learn how to identify acquirers and targets, a process that requires
    a science background so that you can pick the ones that need the banking services

    to understand a few basic concepts surrounding investment banking. We will begin
    by understanding the challenges of an **Initial Public Offer**, commonly known
    as an **IPO**. When a company decides to go to the stock market in order to acquire
    money from the public, they release an IPO for the public and institutions to
    subscribe to. We will also understand the concepts of M&A, as well as how to classify
    investors and apply AI to mergers and acquisitions.

    such as **mergers and acquisitions** (**M&A**), financial opinions such as company
    valuation, and other event-driven financing operators such as management buyout.
    In short, all these activities deal with buying and selling companies and/or company
    assets and pricing them correctly. The easiest way to understand this is by thinking
    about property brokers, appraisers, and mortgage bankers in terms of buying a
    house. M&A is like two people getting married – sometimes, one will be more dominant,
    while other times, it is a marriage of two equal entities. The rationale behind
    this is that a firm exists because it is more efficient to operate, as theorized
    by Ronald Coase in 1937\. As technologies, regulations, and consumer preferences
    change, the economic boundary of a firm changes too, which makes the case for
    M&A.

    right target and help quantify the pricing for post-deal synergies. Both of these
    steps (the first and the last step) are highly unreliable under the existing setting,
    where there is not much science involved. Firstly, bankers' time is very expensive,
    while the mortality rate of any prospection deal is very high (for example, 90%).
    Clients (buyer/seller) will have the incentive of maximizing the banker's service
    hours, even though no deal may be closed. Given the banker's limited time and
    clients' conflicting goal of maximizing the banker's time, regardless of their
    actual intention to close any deal, the best approach is to find the actual economics
    derived from the M&A deal. If it works fundamentally, there shall be a higher
    urgency to announce and engage the investment bankers on deal execution/announcement.

    model, there is bankruptcy occurrence within *X* years; whereas, for mergers,
    it could be an acquisition or divestment announcement within *X* years given the
    financials. I personally do not see any difference between these modeling approaches
    if the probability of bankruptcy can be estimated as such.

    can only be done with proper machine learning models. For example, if the synergy
    is about better market access (for example, competitor A, a buyer, buying competitor
    B in the same industry), the targeting model of competitor A shall be run on competitor
    B's customer database to derive how much revenue will likely be generated. This
    happens with joint database marketing programs; for example, insurance distributed

    to clusters that are too large, which reduces the true positive rate if all the
    clusters are targeted. As per my experience, I would use it for preliminary data
    analysis to understand the major dynamics of the target populations, not necessarily
    to draw actionable insights that make economic sense in a wholesale banking setting.
    In our example, we will create lots of clusters with the very stringent requirement
    that the distance of each data point from the centroid averages a 5% deviation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key question regarding the clustering algorithm is determining how many
    features we feed it. We could commit bias clustering by overweighing certain types
    of financial ratios (for example, using two different kinds of profitability ratios,
    such as return on equity and return on asset) for clustering. The solution to
    this is to run principle component analysis, which removes similar features by
    merging them into the same feature.

- en: There is a shortcut we can use when building the model on stocks, which is also
    a practical consideration. For stocks in an industry that has too few stocks (less
    than 100, for example), there is no need to build a clustering model to help us
    find the subgroups within the industry. Instead, we should go and check every
    single stock if there aren't many of them.

    If we still need more names to approach, then we can run another investor-level
    clustering model to find out who else (investor list B) might be interested in
    this stock that shares similar traits as investor list A.

- en: There has been a long history of corporate finance research in the field of
    acquirers and targets, and our challenge is to apply this rich body of research
    to the real world. Hedge funds have been applying these research findings as merger
    arbitrage, and M&A bankers have always had their eyes on scoring and assessing
    the market on a regular basis (for example, reading the morning news).

- en: In this chapter, we will assume that you are an M&A banker looking for organization
    opportunities. To optimize our time allocation, we can allocate our time better
    by focusing on clients that can close the deal. Therefore, we will use a model
    to predict the probability of us being the acquirers or targets in M&A.

    modeling tools. Over time, data can be captured, and then prediction capability
    can be added to assist bankers in financial modeling. The current world, which
    uses Excel, definitely needs to do more NLP research into how to train a machine
    to parse/understand an Excel-based financial model, which is understood by humans
    but barely understood by the machine at all!

    company has completed any M&A within 1 calendar year, where `1` equals `yes`.
    Then, we joined both company financials and events together—we joined both *t-1*
    years financials with the binary event indicator at year *t*. We converted the
    null event into *0*. Most of this logic is implemented to prepare the financials
    and events, which is done via `download_tkr(tkr)`.
