			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Understanding the AI-Native Product</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will go over the essential components for creating a strategy for building an AI product. This strategy will allow companies a process that will help them succeed in building an AI native tool. In <a href="B18935_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, we briefly introduced the new product development stages, and in this chapter, we will build on that structure by focusing on the most important phases of introducing a new AI/ML native product: ideation, data management, research, development, and deployment. We will also address the main contributors to your AI/ML product team, as well as the tech stack that will empower them. AI native products begin and end with your data, and the roles you fill to support the team responsible for their creation will be critical to their success. When building an AI native tool, do your due diligence so that you aren’t being wasteful of your company’s finances and resources. A bad hire or incorrect tech investment can be costly in both time <span class="No-Break">and resources.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter is primarily for <strong class="bold">product managers</strong> (<strong class="bold">PMs</strong>), technologists, and entrepreneurs coming into the AI space that want to inherently build AI tools. In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following sections:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stages of AI <span class="No-Break">product development</span></li>
				<li>AI/ML product <span class="No-Break">dream team</span></li>
				<li>Investing in your tech stack (further expanding on concepts from the preceding <span class="No-Break">infrastructure section)</span></li>
				<li>Productizing AI-powered outputs—how AI product management <span class="No-Break">is different</span></li>
				<li>Customization for groups—considerations for verticals and <span class="No-Break">customer groupings</span></li>
				<li>Selling AI—product management as a higher octave <span class="No-Break">of sales</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a firm understanding of the most important considerations for every stage of your AI product development life cycle, as well as the development of your product team and the tech stack that will support them. You’ll also be able to think about some of the differences between traditional product management and AI product management, as well as some of the relevant elements when customizing your product for different audiences and how to craft a message that resonates <span class="No-Break">with them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Stages of AI product development</h1>
			<p>Whether your organization is robust enough that you’re supporting multiple product teams for various stages of your AI product development or lean enough that you’re running on a skeleton crew that will see your product through each stage, you’ll want to be cognizant of what these different stages are so that you can define success through each phase. There are <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>various schools of thought on what product management is or should be. We’ll do our best here to summarize the various phases in a way that best summarizes the core aspects of AI <span class="No-Break">product development.</span></p>
			<p>Either way, as an AI PM or leader of an AI product, you’ll want to consider how your product relates to each of the phases described in the following subsections so that you can identify the phase your product is currently in and what you need to do to bring it to <span class="No-Break">full maturity.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Phase 1 – Ideation</h2>
			<p>Just as with the traditional software <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>product life cycle, as a PM you’ll be involved in the ideation phase. You might see this referred to as the innovation or design phase as well. Whatever you call it, this is the phase where the brainstorming on features is happening, and as a PM, you’re a key stakeholder in influencing the direction of the product. This is the phase where you’re also weighing the cost/benefit of incorporating various features, as well as the phase where you’re identifying what are the non-negotiables for <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>One differentiator between traditional software development and AI product development in this phase is that the focus on ideation is paramount before continuing because the costs of investing in an AI product are great. Therefore, you want to be heavily focused on this phase before you move on in the product development life cycle. You don’t want to be going back to the drawing board after you’re in the thick of it with your product only to realize halfway through that you have a better idea of how to leverage AI for your product and have to lose months of work, time integrating a specific tech stack, storage, and <span class="No-Break">expensive headcount.</span></p>
			<p>Ideally, the work in the ideation phase results in getting a picture of what the product will look like using UX mockups/wireframes and surveys, as well as gathering the requirements you need to have in order to properly scope out your MVP. As a PM, perhaps the most important part of your role is understanding what the actual opportunity or problem<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> is you’re addressing. This is true from the market perspective as well as the <span class="No-Break">ML perspective.</span></p>
			<p>Where ML is concerned, you’re using AI to address six main types <span class="No-Break">of problems:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Anomaly detection</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Clustering/peer grouping</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Classification</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Regression</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Recommendations</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Ranking</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Getting clear on which capital-P problem you’re addressing in the market, as well as which ML problem you’re solving based on the six competencies will be your most important task as a PM. Everything else <span class="No-Break">is secondary.</span></p>
			<p>As a PM, you’ll want to bring everyone together here. Your UX, data architects, data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, backend/frontend/full stack engineers, and leadership team will make up the key stakeholders that you’ll want to be involved in this phase so that every voice has a chance to <span class="No-Break">be heard.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of the phase, you should have the <span class="No-Break">following decided:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the outcome/requirements you must have to have a <span class="No-Break">working MVP</span></li>
				<li>How this MVP will <span class="No-Break">be delivered</span></li>
				<li>Who will use <span class="No-Break">this MVP</span></li>
				<li>How they will use <span class="No-Break">this MVP</span></li>
				<li>A clear understanding of the problem/opportunity <span class="No-Break">you’re addressin<a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>g</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Phase 2 – Data management</h2>
			<p>Once you have a clear idea of what you’re building and why, you invest in setting up your product for success. Throughout this <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>book, we refer to AI, ML, and <strong class="bold">deep learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">DL</strong>) products, but it’s important to remember the original colloquialism for any of these products is this: data <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>product. At its core, any product that leverages AI/ML in any way is a data product first, and no data product can be good at anything without lots of quality, clean data. Organizing and expanding on the infrastructure needed to support all your data is the first applied step post-ideation. You’ll want to understand the requirements, constraints, and vocabulary required for a system that supports the data gathering and data processing that will be required to make your AI product function properly because you’ll be central in helping make decisions <span class="No-Break">about this.</span></p>
			<p>In this phase, you’re also defining the best features to use in your AI/ML models. We discussed feature engineering in previous chapters. As a refresher, this is the idea that you’re looking for facets or <em class="italic">features</em> in your dataset that you’re primarily going to use for training your model. You can think of features as the individual columns of data elements that will be most important to include in your model preparation and training. You won’t want to leave this up to your data scientists, engineers, and architects either. As a PM, you’ll want to be intimately involved with and understand the various features that will be selected as the most relevant and final inputs in training the models that will make up <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>Once that’s been decided, this is the phase where the data pipelines to support this data feed will be put in place. Having a good grasp on how you’re setting your organization and product up for sound data collection and preparation, data storage, and data pipeline practices will be crucial in this step as well. These data practices will allow you to leverage data for internal use cases and traditional analytics, and they will also serve as the true foundation of your <span class="No-Break">AI produ<a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>ct.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Phase 3 – Research and development</h2>
			<p>So, you’ve got your plan, you’ve got your data organized, and you’re ready to start building. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>phase, you’re <strong class="bold">researching and developing</strong> (<strong class="bold">R&amp;D</strong>) the actual structure and substance that will make up your AI product. R&amp;D can be synonymous with experimentation. You aren’t going to build a product around one model, and no matter how intuitive and talented your data scientists or ML engineers are, they likely won’t go with the first model that occurs to them either. We’ve gone over the various ML models in previous chapters, and we’ve mentioned a few times that most of the time, ensembles of models are what get used <span class="No-Break">in products.</span></p>
			<p>In the <em class="italic">Deployment strategies</em> section of <a href="B18935_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we introduced the concept of <strong class="bold">A/B testing</strong>, which is sometimes referred to as split testing. Essentially, the<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> process is relevant here as well because there will be a fair amount of A/B testing and evaluation in this process, so you’ll want to understand the basics of A/B testing as well as data distributions, cohorts, confidence intervals, and other probabilistic<a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> concepts. A/B testing is a common testing method used in ML, and if you’d like to get into this topic as it relates to AI/ML products, we recommend this <span class="No-Break">resource: </span><a href="https://mlops.community/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-b-testing-in-ml/#:~:text=An%20A%2FB%20test%2C%20also,guesswork"><span class="No-Break">https://mlops.community/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-b-testing-in-ml/#:~:text=An%20A%2FB%20test%2C%20also,guesswork</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This phase also means there’s a fair amount of experimentation that needs to take place before a model is selected for your specific use case. If you’re hiring the most experienced data scientists and ML engineers and you see them going back and forth with different models, seemingly unable to choose and wanting to further experiment until they see performance they can get on board with this is normal. Hiring a talented, knowledgeable, and experienced headcount is only one side of the coin with <span class="No-Break">AI products.</span></p>
			<p>Sure—they have the know-how, but they aren’t business experts. They’re experts in modeling and creating algorithms that will fit the use case the business experts outline for them. Use the R&amp;D phase as a way to give your data scientists and ML engineers the proper direction, and manage expectations with them. You’ll want to properly set these hires up with the proper tools, stakeholders, and resources to make them successful. There are other considerations as well. Let’s take the notion of performance. As a PM, it could be up to you, rather than the data scientists, to decide what level of performance or precision level would be most acceptable for the customers you’re trying to serve. Establishing these thresholds and expectations is something you, as the AI PM, will be regularly doing with <span class="No-Break">your<a id="_idTextAnchor184"/> team.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Phase 4 – Deployment</h2>
			<p>We’re using deployment as<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> an umbrella term here for everything that comes after the R&amp;D phase. At this point, you’ve settled on a model or a collection of models that satisfies your products’ ideation and MVP requirements, is supported by your data infrastructure, and has been thoroughly tested. Now, you’re ready to build the supporting infrastructure to make sure this model and its outputs can be integrated into the broader product that your end users will experience. This is the deployment phase where you’re marrying the work of your data scientists and ML engineers to the work of your full stack developers and actually integrating it into the greater product that will support these <span class="No-Break">AI/ML outputs.</span></p>
			<p>Your product may have many <em class="italic">features</em>, and only a couple of them may be <em class="italic">AI features</em>, or the very heart of your product could be ML. Regardless of how rooted in AI your product is, you will need to deploy the ML findings from the models you’ve invested time in building in the context of the greater UI/UX. Because of this integrative dance that has to happen between your AI/ML code and your production code, you might go through your own R&amp;D<a id="_idIndexMarker265"/> phase with deployment as well. Selecting the proper ML model and technique is a separate process from selecting the proper way to showcase and use the outputs of that ML R&amp;D and how to maintain <span class="No-Break">those outputs.</span></p>
			<p>The broader context of the deployment phase is really to create continuity and delivery of the substance of your ML outputs. This is also where you’ll be creating processes and structure around the continuous maintenance and delivery of your product that were outlined in <a href="B18935_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the various phases of the AI product development life cycle, let’s focus on the folks that will make the magic happen in the first place: the AI product team. Building a new team for a new AI product is tricky, and it can be tough to adequately hire for the needs your product will have. Every product and company will have different needs, so we will try to remain as objective as possible in <span class="No-Break">this <a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>AI/ML product dream team</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will be spending <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>some time understanding the various roles that will empower your AI product team to maximize success. We’ll also be grouping these functions across the stages we outlined in the preceding sections so that we can get a sense of when these roles come into play. Note that not all these roles will be necessary in your organization. Every organization is different and will have different needs. Use your discretion when building your AI teams. You may include other stakeholders in your AI program, but the following is a relatively complete list of the main stakeholders you will want to include in your hiring process as your AI/ML product <span class="No-Break">team grows.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll now look at a <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>cumulative list of roles that will likely apply to your ideal AI dream team. We have listed the roles in order of <span class="No-Break">common <a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>appearance.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>AI PM</h2>
			<p>Here, we start on our journey of <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>creating a dream team. All organizations are different. Some won’t hire PMs until they’re further along with building an MVP. Others might hire <em class="italic">founding</em> PMs. Others might already be mature organizations and are just ready to launch their first AI product. No matter where your organization lies, you will eventually need all the activities required to support an AI/ML product to be centralized into <span class="No-Break">one person.</span></p>
			<p>A product is a living breathing ecosystem in and of itself, so having a point person to go to that can be responsive to and responsible for the needs of various parts of that ecosystem will be important. Because of our own bias, we will place the AI PM firmly at the beginning of this list. Finding someone that’s worked with or specialized in AI/ML products in the past will serve as your due diligence for making sure your product is properly set up for success. We consider it ideal to hire for this role before you start hiring for other roles to maintain a cohesive vision across your product. Having an AI/ML PM on board before you begin the implementation of your product means that person is aware of the historical discussions and market influences to support your <span class="No-Break">pr<a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>oduct best.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>AI/ML/data strategists</h2>
			<p>This will be more of a consultative<a id="_idIndexMarker269"/> role for most companies. Ideally, this person would help with the acquisition of talent, along with developing methodologies and workflows that would support your AI/ML function/team in its entirety. This might be a role that you hire for at the start of your AI/ML journey to help with key decisions about who to hire for various roles in your AI program or product team, what should be included in your tech stack, and how certain workflows should be set up with regard to experimentation <span class="No-Break">and deployment.</span></p>
			<p>This may be someone that stays on for the planning and initial phases of your product development (first 6-8 months) or someone that you keep on staff as a PM in more resourced environments. This person will also ideally be well versed in AI ethics principles. If you’re a start-up and you’re creating a company and a product from scratch, this might be your<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> technical cofounder who is able to act as your technical decision-maker. This role could also be referred to as a data <span class="No-Break">a<a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>rchitect role.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Data engineer</h2>
			<p>We have an architect <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>for how the AI product/program team will function; now, we start laying down the foundations for our data pipelines with a data engineer based on the blueprint that’s come out of our collaboration with an AI strategist. If you’re setting up an AI product from scratch, look for a data engineer that can help support your team’s choices of data <span class="No-Break">engineering philosophies.</span></p>
			<p>Will you be using a data mesh, a data fabric, a data lake, or a data warehouse? Because you’re starting this function from the beginning for an AI/ML native product, you’ll want to hire someone with the confidence and experience to help guide you with a proper setup. Migrating and changing your data architecture can be expensive and time-consuming. If you get the help you need properly at the beginning, it will save you potential headaches later and give you a sustainable, scalable infrastructure to grow <span class="No-Break">w<a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>ith confidence.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Data analyst</h2>
			<p>A path for many companies <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>will be to build on an already established foundation of data analytics before they start expanding on those analytics with ML. The traditional order of operations is gaining clarity and control over your data by hiring amazing data analysts first that will quickly figure out what’s interesting and worth exploring in the data you already have. In this role, you’re looking for someone that’s able to quickly analyze your swathes of data with curiosity <span class="No-Break">and exploration.</span></p>
			<p>This is the person that might be your expert query maker, working in concert with your data engineer to feed queries through the workflows you establish to power your AI/ML product. These will also be the hires that will improve on the analytics you use internally to improve internal <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>processes as well as the analytics you pass on to your customers through your product or platform’s<a id="_idTextAnchor196"/> <span class="No-Break">dashboard UI/UX.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Data scientist</h2>
			<p>Once you have the ability to<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> generate and move data, you’re ready to start experimenting with that data, and you’ll eventually need to collaborate with someone that’s an expert at model building. In order to be an expert at model building, you have to also be an expert at ML algorithms, big data, statistics, and programming. Most companies are coding in Python, so unless you’re serving academic circles, we recommend sticking with Python. This role doesn’t just need technical skills—it also needs soft skills because it’s a collaborative role, and it also communicates heavily <span class="No-Break">with leadership.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, you’re hiring a data scientist to execute the business goals you’ve established early on. This person should have a strong business acumen and must be able to understand the impact and purpose of their work. They should also have the expertise to technically and functionally realize the algorithmic solution that best fits your organization, data, and product. This role is inherently elusive to fill because finding someone with competence and experience in all these areas proves to be difficult for most organizations, particularly when you’re in the early phases of creating a start-up or a product fr<a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>om <span class="No-Break">the beginning.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>ML engineer</h2>
			<p>At this point, you’ve got a firm handle<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> on your strategy, your data architecture, the capabilities of your customer/product data, and the models you’ll be using in your product. Your goals and objectives have been outlined and confirmed by the technical stakeholders on your leadership team. Taking a cumulative approach, by this point you can outsource the execution of this planning-heavy part of establishing your AI/ML product or program. ML engineers are able to use the models and algorithms whipped up by your data scientists by incorporating (coding) them into the workflows or code repository for <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>Again, because this is a role that will support the AI native product, this role will have the burden of getting in the weeds with your data and algorithms to see what comes out. This person can expect to do a lot of trial and error as they feel their way toward acceptable performance. Your ML engineer will use the data that’s been vetted by your data analysts and marry it with the algorithms your data scientists have selected in their work. Nothing really matters until you actually deploy something into production. The act of putting it all together<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> and ultimately deploying the code that supports all the prior functions falls on the applied ML engineer that makes the dream team. Depending on your organization, you might have to make a choice between a data scientist <a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>and an <span class="No-Break">ML engineer.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Frontend/backend/full stack engineers</h2>
			<p>Various manifestations of the preceding five roles exist in many capacities. Your particular organization might not need them all, all at once. But one thing’s for sure: no matter how you navigate the previous five roles, you will always need full stack engineering to support the AI/ML<a id="_idIndexMarker277"/> work that needs to be done before it’s time for deployment. ML engineers are able to add the AI/ML functions to your code base, but you’ll need built-out engineering teams to be supporting your product end to end. Your frontend, backend, and full stack engineers will collaborate with your ML engineers and data scientists often for the AI/ML <span class="No-Break">native product.</span></p>
			<p>Structuring these teams so that they’re working intimately and have deep trust built between them will be important. Most of the time, any AI/ML product will have plenty of features and needs that don’t have anything to do with the AI/ML aspect of your product. You’ll need a built-out engineering team that manages the tasks and epics in your sprints outside of the AI/ML function. These are the folks that are going to get you set up with a working MVP of your product that you can iterate on as you continue in your product management journey. You don’t have a working product until y<a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>ou’re in <span class="No-Break">this phase.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>UX designers/researchers</h2>
			<p>The manifestation of your MVP is your product’s <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>starting point. You can’t iterate a product that doesn’t yet exist, and reaching MVP level allows you a confident start. Depending on your organization and philosophy, you may already have leveraged UI/UX feedback during the planning phases. Perhaps you did have a product designer on board early on, or perhaps you worked with a UX researcher when you were doing your early market reconnaissance. But once you have a working product MVP, you’re able to establish a baseline with your users (or beta users) and get a sense of how they’re receiving value from <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>UI/UX is all about how to most efficiently deliver value to your end users. Minimizing sources of frustration and inspiring moments of delight is the primary focus of this function. A good UI/UX designer or researcher will guide the visible changes of your product that your end users<a id="_idIndexMarker279"/> will experience. We recommend having this function be an ongoing engagement so that you can learn from your users as you build further iterations of your product that align most closely with what your users—and, by extension, thei<a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>r <span class="No-Break">buyers—will approve.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Customer success</h2>
			<p>Having proper channels for<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> listening via UI/UX design and research is important, but eventually, your customers will want you to talk back—and not just through the product itself. You might not have a huge need for a customer success team if you’re creating a B2C product, but if you’re selling an AI/ML product to other businesses, you certainly will. The customer success team exists to make sure your customers are properly using your product and receiving the intended value <span class="No-Break">from it.</span></p>
			<p>They’re also a great source of feedback for your data and AI/ML functions. The customer success team offers the feedback loop that an AI/ML product will need to build and improve over time. They’re also incredibly helpful at helping to expand on product features and collaborating with products on which potential new features end users might really love to see. If you’re an AI/ML PM, make sure you have a warm and open relationship with the customer success team because they’re your biggest source of knowledge on the ground. They’re the ones actually ta<a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>lking to <span class="No-Break">your customers!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Marketing/sales/go-to-market team</h2>
			<p>This is another one that will likely be <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>involved at the beginning and throughout your product development journey. We’re lumping in sales and marketing as <strong class="bold">go-to-market</strong> (<strong class="bold">GTM</strong>) because this is essentially what this function does. It communicates out to your market: the entire landscape of your potential customers. This is where you’ll combine your skill sets to optimize your product language fit or the message your market will see about <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>your product. You’ll be using your GTM meetings to decide on <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Terminology about <span class="No-Break">your product</span></li>
				<li>How you’re going to position it in <span class="No-Break">the market</span></li>
				<li>How much of your proprietary tech and algorithmic magic you’re going to allow your salesforce to discuss with potential customers <span class="No-Break">on demos</span></li>
				<li>How much explainability you’re going <span class="No-Break">to offer</span></li>
				<li>How you’re going to communicate about technical decisions you’ve made about <span class="No-Break">your product</span></li>
				<li>How much information about your product you’re going to shield from the world in the spirit <span class="No-Break">of competition</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you build and improve your product, your GTM team will stick with you, and you’ll be regularly in the flow of discussing how you’re going to communicate about upcom<a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>ing features <span class="No-Break">or releases.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Investing in your tech stack</h1>
			<p>Understanding the tech<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> stack and languages that will give you the most flexibility is the most important part of beginning your tech stack journey. In this phase, you’ll work closely with your data science and data engineering teams to create the proper channels for delivering the relevant data to your models in a reliable way so that all the other stakeholders involved in building your product can trust the infrastructure <span class="No-Break">in place.</span></p>
			<p>Managing ML experimentation is a formidable undertaking in and of itself, and we’ve seen tools such as MLflow and Weights &amp; Biases used for managing versions and experiments. You can also use tools such as Cloudera Data Science Workbench, Seldon, Dataiku, DataRobot, Domino, SageMaker, and TensorFlow to support your data scientists with a workstation for building, experimenting with, deploying, and training <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<p>As a PM, you’re regularly thinking about the value of building something compared to the cost or effort required to build it. This is why you can’t ignore your tech stack. It might be tempting to say, well, a CTO can decide on which tech stack to invest in, but it’s not so easy to outsource<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/> if this tech stack is directly involved with the building of your product in any way. Empowering your stakeholders impacts the effort and cost that goes into your AI product, so you’ll want to make sure you’re involved in the making of these <span class="No-Break">key decisions.</span></p>
			<p>The biggest consideration in your tech stack is paying attention to properly setting up your infrastructure to handle the scale of your data as your business grows. Building the right tech stack to handle the cleansing, storing, securing, preparing, and monitoring of your data will be the foundation for supporting your AI program or product team. This goes hand in hand with building your data strategy. Beyond this, you’ll seek to create a collaborative environment for the many roles in your AI program to participate in. Between the analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, broader engineering team, and any leaders and consultants you include in the formation of your AI team, you’ll want to create channels for all these various members to communicate <span class="No-Break">and collaborate.</span></p>
			<p>As is the case with many AI programs, you’ll also be looking for ways to automate your processes and workflows. AI/ML technologies are consistently changing and improving, so you’ll make a lot of traction when you invest in applying automation for your AI program itself. Use the brainpower of your talented staff to make higher-level decisions and use their complex problem-solving abilities. Anything that can be automated, refreshed, or standardized should be. This aligns with the precepts of agile and lean development. Refactoring and making elegant improvements in your code should be done proactively, so make sure to plan this into your springs responsibly and use the advantages of your tech stack in your favor to set your team up <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
			<p>Having the right process, talent, and tech stack to power your AI product is just the beginning. You’re bringing all the necessary elements together to create AI-powered outputs. Those outputs will be integrated into your product somehow in the form of features that your customers will experience the benefit of. The next section will be about understanding how to orient the outputs of your AI/ML program and team in a way that’s most<a id="_idTextAnchor210"/> evident to <span class="No-Break">your customers.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Productizing AI-powered outputs – how AI product management is different</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will be exploring the <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>difference between product management for traditional products and product management for AI/ML products. At first glance, it may seem that AI/ML products aren’t that different from traditional products. We’re still creating a baseline of value, use, performance, and functionality and optimizing that baseline as best we can. This is true for every product as well as for the greater practice of product management, and this won’t change just because our product works <span class="No-Break">with AI.</span></p>
			<p>The true differentiator when it comes to AI products is you’re essentially productizing a service. Think about it for a moment. In order for AI to work, it has to learn from your (or your customer’s) data. Different models might work better on different kinds of data. Different datasets will require different hyperparameters from your models. This is the nature of AI/ML. In a way, this means that you could find yourself in a situation where the way you build and structure your product could even change fundamentally from one customer to another, especially at first when you have very <span class="No-Break">few customers.</span></p>
			<p>What this effectively means is you’re understanding how all your customers are benefiting from the AI/ML <em class="italic">service</em> you’re providing your customers and establishing a standard procedure for recreating that process so that all your customers are able to experience the highest benefit. The general advice when productizing a service is first to find a niche or a specific cohort of customers to reach. If you can understand how AI is most helping your customers through your product and you’re able to focus on what value means for your customers’ success, you’ve begun the first steps <span class="No-Break">of productizing.</span></p>
			<p>The main focus will then be on how to best structure your product and internal processes so that you’re not starting from scratch with every customer. This will be exploratory at first. Perhaps certain models are working better with some customers’ data than others. Perhaps there are specific use cases that didn’t arise until one of your customers asked for them. The basic idea of productizing is finding something that has value and brainstorming to understand where else you can leverage a previous project, output, or process for the betterment of all. Waste not, want not. If you can recycle something for the benefit of your collection of customers, it will add to the success and collective love your <span class="No-Break">product receives.</span></p>
			<p>Productizing services is a familiar concept in consulting where consultants are working project to project and often have to create new engagements with clients with an almost blank slate. But given that our own minds are pattern detection machines, eventually, we start to see similar requests come in or similar use cases pop up. Creating a repeatable process for certain types of customers, verticals, profiles, or use cases is the very essence of <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>productizing. This is exactly what we’re doing with AI/ML products. This is also a way to better anticipate how and why your customers are coming to you and your product specifically so that you know how to share successes and case studies that apply directly to them. The act of productizing will also immensely empower your marketing, sales, customer success, and broader <span class="No-Break">GTM teams.</span></p>
			<p>As we have seen in this section, AI/ML product integration is about finding the balance between the outputs of your models and the use cases or groups those outputs are trying to serve. Many PMs come out of the experience of building with AI/ML finding they may need to customize their product for certain cohorts. In the following section, we’re going to address the need for AI c<a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>ustomization should <span class="No-Break">it arise.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>AI customization</h1>
			<p>Through the act of productizing, you’ll likely start to create groupings or cohorts for your product. You might find that<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> certain models work best for certain kinds of customers and build a structure around that. The act of grouping your offering into use cases and communicating differently or optimally to those cohorts builds on the wisdom gained from productizing. Taking that a step further, you’ll then naturally start <span class="No-Break">to verticalize.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding the various considerations for business models, verticals, and special customer groupings will be an important part of how you go to market with your product. For instance, if you’re supporting a B2C or consumer product, you’ll want to invest more in information gathering by acquiring more of your end users’ direct feedback for your ideation phase. Because you’ll be creating a product that’s going to be experienced by potentially millions of users, you will want a strong handle on the preferences and desires of those end users so that your product is most aligned with the <em class="italic">voice</em> of your customer. A product such as this could also benefit from experimenting and iterating fast so that you can get a product out and start gathering feedback on it before you’re even getting your desired level of performance from the AI/ML <span class="No-Break">models themselves.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re supporting  B2B or business-facing apps, you might spend more time on the ideation and deployment of that product so that you can zero in on the specific set of customers you’re hoping to win over. With business applications, you might be creating a very complex product that does a number of overlapping operations but for a very niche group of users. You might also have a wide variety of well-documented tools that offer similar solutions to<a id="_idIndexMarker288"/> your customers, so maintaining feature parity with the market could be more of a factor for this line <span class="No-Break">of products.</span></p>
			<p>The size of your business will also impact how you show up in your organization as an AI PM. For instance, if your organization is large enough, there might be a separate PM allocated to every version of the product cycles mentioned previously. There could also be various PMs that support various aspects of the functionality of your AI product. There could also be a PM that’s devoted only to the AI features of the product with a higher-level PM or product director overseeing the entire suite. In a smaller organization, there might be only one AI PM overseeing the entirety of the product throughout all the phases of the life cycle or ideating to continuously maintain <span class="No-Break">that product.</span></p>
			<p>Another differentiation between the sizes of companies lies in the data itself. Depending on how large your company is, the access or quality of the data you have can have varying degrees of difficulty. As a PM, making this data available and in a usable condition could prove more difficult and take up more of your time than it would at a start-up because of having to get access to siloed groupings of data that require administrative governance permissions. Even getting that data to fit together could be tough, depending on the conventions of each silo. Conversely, a start-up might have a hard time even amassing enough users and have issues with data volumes. Data availability and quality are notorious issues for companies big <span class="No-Break">and small.</span></p>
			<p>If you have a highly verticalized product, this could also impact how your work shows up as an AI PM. For instance, having a product that’s specialized for healthcare, fintech, or education might necessitate a PM that has domain knowledge and expertise in these different verticals. Even if it’s the same PM that’s supporting this product for those verticals, you’ll likely see it as three different versions of your product because the weights, thresholds, and performance metrics for these specific verticals will likely be drastically different. Depending on the type of product you’re offering, you might even see a hyper-specialization to the point where the product is customized heavily even for every customer you have! This might be the case for highly tailored ML products that have to be fit to your <span class="No-Break">clients’ data.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, the work of building products and crafting them for specific audiences is all about creating a product<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> that sells. We need to be able to understand our audience—the buyers and users of our products—in order to build something that will truly serve them. In the next section, we will discuss the notion of selling and what that means from a<a id="_idTextAnchor214"/> product <span class="No-Break">management perspective.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Selling AI – product management as a higher octave  of sales</h1>
			<p>With AI product management, you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> selling in a number of ways. There’s the traditional sense of selling, which is this: creating a product that your market wants to buy. This is inherent in any traditional PM role. Your understanding of your market, your product, and your salesforce is one where you’re confident in the solution you’re bringing to market, your solution’s performance, and your salesforce’s ability to articulate the value of the solution you’re building. Then, there’s the opportunity and challenge AI presents: the ability to sell the AI <span class="No-Break">functionality itself.</span></p>
			<p>Earlier in this book, we mentioned the difficulty AI/ML projects have in being deployed into production; this happens for a number of reasons, but among the top reasons is the inability to sell the value of AI to the broader organization. This will be incredibly relevant to any PM that’s looking to work with AI products because you will have to develop this intuition and ability to sell your product to the outside market as well as to your internal stakeholders and leaders. This is the case whether you work at a large organization or a <span class="No-Break">small start-up.</span></p>
			<p>Part of the work of selling AI within your organization is going to directly correlate with how you empower your teams. If you want to be successful in evangelizing your AI product, we have the <span class="No-Break">following advice:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure there’s alignment on the data strategy and data architecture side. Remember: AI products are data products, and if you don’t have sound practices on the data end, you’ll have to reverse engineer your data pipelines, and that’s not fun. Part of this is also making sure there is a sound data strategy that will grow as your business and product scale to support more users <span class="No-Break">and customers.</span></li>
				<li>Make sure that you are not focusing so much on the technology and tech stack that you’re forgetting about tying the use of that technology to impact. Remind yourself why you want to use AI for your product. What value is it providing your product and, by extension, your organization and customers? No sale is successful without perceived value. People that work in sales understand they need to be successful in communicating the value of their product before you’ll open your wallet. You’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>have to have the same mentality if you’re working in product management. This isn’t just relevant for your customers but for your leadership team <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></li>
				<li>Make sure you’re embracing experimentation. As we’ve said countless times: AI/ML is a highly iterative process. You can’t load up your practitioners and the models themselves with expectations and results without first allowing them the space to experiment. Beautiful, miraculous things can happen with AI/ML but first they need to be coaxed through iteration. Flexibility and curiosity will also be important when you’re considering various ML models that will support your product as it scales <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As with other product roles, the role of an AI PM is vast and requires knowledge and competencies in several areas. Having an understanding of how an AI product is created and brainstormed allows you to meet your market’s needs with leading-edge technology. Knowing how to best support the data end of such a product means you are setting up the most integral members of your AI team for success. Allowing your hands-on AI practitioners the space and ownership to experiment and report their findings to you and your leadership creates the proper feedback loop between tech and leadership to see your product flourish. Finally, creating the proper deployment tech stack and process ensures your end users are benefiting from your product in the way you originally intended and gives you the perfect board with which to dive into the day-to-day of iterating on y<a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>our product until its <span class="No-Break">sunset days.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The work of a PM is never done. There are always more voices, perspectives, and considerations to take in. Coordinating all the stakeholders, technology, leadership, market analysis, customer feedback, and passion for a product isn’t an easy task. In this chapter, we covered the stages of the AI product development life cycle and the various roles that can make up your AI product dream team. We also covered the tech stack that can help that team build a product, and various focus areas to help that product stand out and resonate with the cohorts of groups that will be buying and using your product. Hopefully, this chapter has helped you understand what the most important factors are when you set out to build an AI <span class="No-Break">native product.</span></p>
			<p>As long as you’re hiring the right people for the roles you have open in your AI program, doing your due diligence to uncover the right strategy for tech stack adoption, structuring your product in a way that benefits your customers according to their verticals, and working with your leadership and greater GTM team to build a product that meets a need in your market, you’ll be set up for success. You’re likely to do better than <span class="No-Break">you think.</span></p>
