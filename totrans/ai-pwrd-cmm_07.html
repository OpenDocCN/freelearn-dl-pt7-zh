			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Understanding the challenges of wireless networking brands</h1>
			<p>Let's start<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> by exploring economic and technological challenges in the wireless networking industry, and how they affect the way wireless networking <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>brands are positioned in the marketplace. This will lay the framework for understanding why data-driven and AI-powered solutions are needed.</p>
			<p>In particular, we'll discuss challenges related to the growth in wireless networking traffic and associated performance challenges, as well as increasing ecosystem complexity, and needs for sustainability, 5G, and becoming data-driven.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Growth in traffic</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>wireless networking industry is undergoing a period of significant change. The growth in mobile usage and <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) devices, as <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>well as the demand for hotspots, has created an unprecedented surge in demand for connectivity – and the need for new ways to meet this demand.</p>
			<p>The number of unique<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> users connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots has quadrupled over the past 5 years, according to Statista (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/677108/global-public-wi-fi-hotspots/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/677108/global-public-wi-fi-hotspots/</a>). Since 2019, there have been more mobile devices than people.</p>
			<p>However, this growth has come at a cost to the operators of these hotspots, who must invest heavily in infrastructure to handle the increased demand. Wireless networking operators are increasingly responsible for providing a reliable and scalable network that will meet the growing demand of users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Performance challenges</h2>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>growth in traffic has important implications for network performance. Network performance continues to be an issue that plagues both wired and wireless networks globally because there are only so many antennas available for signal amplification, satellites are expensive to launch into space, and cell towers must contend with interference from other wireless networks.</p>
			<p>However, these limitations don't mean that network performance has been stagnant; quite the contrary. We continue to see advancements in network architecture thanks in large part to advancements<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> in <strong class="bold">software-defined networking</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDN</strong>), which creates virtual networks within an existing physical infrastructure using software, instead of hardware components such as switches or routers.</p>
			<p>SDN allows networks operators to dynamically shape traffic patterns across connected devices without impacting end-user experiences such as speed or latency. This flexibility allows operators greater control over how they utilize their network infrastructure which can then be used strategically – think about allocating resources to certain types of applications rather than having applications compete against each other for limited bandwidth resources when running simultaneously on one device, network connection, or geographic region.</p>
			<p>With this level of control comes great responsibility; providers must make sure that users aren't negatively impacted during times when demand outweighs available capacity, which results in slower download speeds or dropped connections.</p>
			<p>This unprecedented rise in demand for wireless connectivity also poses a huge opportunity for brands that are able to capitalize on it with innovative products and services tailored around consumers' specific needs and preferences.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">What does this mean for you as a brand?</em> It means that if you can figure out how to best serve your customers' wireless connectivity needs, they could become lifelong customers who buy into your brand and its values every time they connect wirelessly – especially if you can provide them with something better than what they'd get from competing brands or non-branded alternatives. This valuable information can be extracted from product and consumer data, including product reviews from sources such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target.</p>
			<p>And since today's customers are tomorrow's referred customers, investing in data and AI now could pay off <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>big later, when these future customers become loyal brand advocates and evangelists who can help bring in more new business down the line.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Increasing complexity</h2>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> major challenge brands are facing is the increasing complexity of the wireless connectivity ecosystem.</p>
			<p>When you think about it, there are more parts in an electronic device (such as transistors in a chip) than there are in an automobile engine. With each passing year, these pieces become increasingly important as they influence how well our devices function.</p>
			<p>At the same time, consumers have more options than ever when it comes to choosing which devices they'd like to use for specific applications or functions. For instance, tablets and laptops can be used for productivity purposes, while smartphones are more often used for social media or entertainment. Meanwhile, wearables can be used for health monitoring, smart speakers can be used for listening to podcasts or streaming music, and VR headsets can be used for immersive experiences. The list goes on and on.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">So how do you figure out what your customers need – and want – when it comes to connecting wirelessly?</em> It will require a significant investment of both time and resources as you identify what your target customer wants, needs, values, and dreams of for their own personal wireless experience.</p>
			<p>Then, you'll need to figure out how best to provide them with that experience through new products and services that meet their needs within the context of your brand's overall value proposition.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Sustainability</h2>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>third major challenge that wireless networking brands are facing is the need to become more sustainable. Many consumers are concerned about the environmental impact of their wireless connectivity habits, and as a result, they're looking for ways to be greener when it comes to their daily digital lives.</p>
			<p>This has created a huge opportunity for wireless networking companies that are able to create products and services that help people reduce their carbon footprint. From helping people reduce their energy consumption by providing energy-efficient devices, or even offering devices that give back to environmental organizations – there are countless examples of how wireless connectivity can be used to help people lead a greener life.</p>
			<p>While it's <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>certainly not easy given the wide array of challenges that need to be overcome when creating sustainable products and services, becoming more sustainable is certainly something that many brands are starting to take seriously. Brands are realizing the importance of being able to differentiate themselves from the competition through their environmental impact.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Becoming data-driven</h2>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> important challenge that the wireless networking brands will have to overcome is the need to become more data-driven. Many consumers today are bombarded by so much information every day that they often feel overwhelmed and incapable of making informed decisions when it comes to their wireless connectivity needs.</p>
			<p>Brands that are able to provide customers with relevant, actionable information will be able to establish a distinct advantage over competitors that may not be as data-driven. In order for brands to do this, they'll need to invest in the delivery of real-time insights and data analytics that can help them understand how best to serve their customers' specific wireless connectivity needs – and in turn, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>5G</h2>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>key challenge relates to 5G, which will be an even bigger game-changer than 4G when it comes to the wireless connectivity industry. 5G <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>will usher in a new age of connectivity, one that is over 10 times faster than current 4G networks.</p>
			<p>When 5G becomes truly mainstream, people will be able to do things they've only dreamed about before, such as stream movies and play games on-the-go without delay – and all of this will be possible thanks to the ultra-low latency that 5G offers.</p>
			<p>But what makes 5G so exciting from a technology standpoint is also what makes it so challenging for brands that are looking to capitalize on this opportunity. There are still many questions surrounding its rollout and adoption rates, meaning that there's no guarantee that consumers will want to buy into the experience or use their wireless connectivity products and services in the same way as they have with previous generations of networks.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>good news is that once these issues are worked out over time – through increased network coverage as well as customer education about the benefits of ultra-low latency connectivity – the potential for growth in demand for 5G products and services will increase significantly. This means that if you can figure out how to create a compelling user experience for your customers around ultra-low latency connectivity, then you could see tremendous growth as more people become early adopters of this new capability.</p>
			<p>To summarize these challenges, brand owners in the wireless ecosystem should consider themselves fortunate: with all these opportunities at hand, there's no reason why any brand can't achieve success by creating products and services that help meet their customers' ever-changing needs.</p>
			<p>It's also <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>important to remember that if you can imagine it, then someone somewhere has already created something similar – and now they're trying to take your idea and make it better by leveraging their expertise in hardware design or software development or both.</p>
			<p>That's why it's important for brands to think long-term about how they position themselves within an increasingly crowded marketplace. Analyzing product data can help brands overcome these challenges.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Analyzing product data for wireless networking brands</h1>
			<p>Data has <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>become a critical differentiating <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>factor for brands as consumers seek out products and services that offer them added utility, convenience, or even fun. For instance, much of the early adoption of on-demand transportation services such as Uber and Lyft was driven by their ability to provide riders with real-time updates regarding their location and ETA.</p>
			<p>The same can be said for how we use our smartphones – we increasingly expect data-driven experiences from our devices, whether it's instant information about nearby restaurants or <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>attractions while on vacation or seamless integration with household appliances via voice commands or an app interface. And this trend doesn't show signs of slowing down anytime soon – by 2025, the world will be generating nearly 500 exabytes of data a day!</p>
			<p>As the <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>number of connected devices increases, so does the amount of data that flows through networks. This increase in traffic is creating a massive opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves by providing users with value-added services and content. Additionally, brands can harness product data, and in particular, product review data, to build more innovative products and services.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at an example of analyzing product review data for a router.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Analyzing wireless networking product review data</h2>
			<p>A consumer <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>buys a new wireless router, connects it to their home network, and starts using it. The consumer <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>may post a positive review on Amazon about how easy it is to set up the device and use it around the house. This review can help improve product satisfaction and usage among other consumers who read the review. The manufacturer of the router could analyze this product review data to see what features consumers liked most about their device and use that information to improve future products.</p>
			<p>On the flip side, a frustrated consumer may post a negative review, which will push away potential buyers. However, this negative review represents a valuable learning experience to find and fix flaws in the router.</p>
			<p>By using the data generated from these reviews, it has been shown that manufacturers can improve product satisfaction and usage rates among consumers.</p>
			<p>Product feedback is a critical component of any successful product launch or <strong class="bold">product lifecycle management</strong> (<strong class="bold">PLM</strong>). The PLM process allows manufacturers to understand how their <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>products are being used by customers and generate actionable insights that help them make informed decisions about product design and development. This insight can be used by companies to improve customer experience, differentiate their offerings in the market, and increase sales. The more data that a company generates through its PLM approach, the better position it will be in to achieve success in today's highly competitive market landscape.</p>
			<p>Let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>a practical <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>example of analyzing over 700 anonymized product reviews for a wireless 5G router:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we'll import <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>our dependencies, or simply the libraries we'll need to analyze the text, sentiment, keyword frequency, and other metrics of the reviews:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">!pip install wordcloud</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">from os import path</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">from PIL import Image</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">import pandas as pd</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">import numpy as np</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">!pip install textblob</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">from textblob import TextBlob</strong></p></li>
				<li>Now we can read in the product review data, and turn it all into one string, which we can use to create a word cloud to give some high-level insight into what consumers are talking about:<p class="source-code">df = pd.read_csv('Reviews.csv')</p><p class="source-code">document = df['Reviews'].to_string()</p></li>
				<li>We can now use the <strong class="source-inline">WordCloud</strong> library to generate a word cloud, like so:<p class="source-code">wordcloud = WordCloud().generate(document)</p><p class="source-code">plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')</p><p class="source-code">plt.axis("off")</p><p>The preceding code generates a word cloud, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 5.1</em>, which, besides <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>obvious terms such as router, shows that consumers are talking a lot about <strong class="bold">5G</strong> and <strong class="bold">range</strong>:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.1_B17967.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – A word cloud of 5G wireless router reviews&#13;&#10;" width="1393" height="693"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – A word cloud of 5G wireless router reviews</p>
			<p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>now use <strong class="source-inline">TextBlob</strong> to analyze review sentiment and see whether we can find more meaningful insights. We'll want to ensure that each review is properly formatted as a string, and then we can apply the <strong class="source-inline">TextBlob</strong> <strong class="source-inline">sentiment</strong> function to each review, or each row in the DataFrame, via a <strong class="source-inline">lambda</strong> function. This will create two new columns: one showing <strong class="source-inline">polarity</strong> and one showing <strong class="source-inline">subjectivity</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">polarity</strong> is a float in the range of [<strong class="source-inline">-1,1</strong>], where <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> means a positive statement, <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> means a neutral statement, and <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong> means a negative statement. <strong class="source-inline">subjectivity</strong> refers to the presence of personal opinion, emotion, or judgment. <strong class="source-inline">subjectivity</strong> is also a float, which lies in the range of [<strong class="source-inline">0,1</strong>]:</p>
			<p class="source-code">s = df['Reviews']</p>
			<p class="source-code">df['Reviews'] = df['Reviews'].astype(str)</p>
			<p class="source-code">df = df[df['Reviews'] == s]</p>
			<p class="source-code">df[['polarity', 'subjectivity']] = df['Reviews'].apply(lambda   Text: pd.Series(TextBlob(Text).sentiment))</p>
			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> calculated sentiment, we can easily sort and search for product reviews by sentiment. For example, the following code will show us negative reviews:</p>
			<p class="source-code">df[df['polarity'] &lt; 0]</p>
			<p>Looking <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>at a snippet of five negative reviews, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em>, shows us that they're mostly related to the poor range of the router:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.2_B17967.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – A snippet of negative wireless router product reviews&#13;&#10;" width="1081" height="363"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – A snippet of negative wireless router product reviews</p>
			<p>Let's also take a look at more positive reviews, with a positive <strong class="source-inline">polarity</strong> and fairly low <strong class="source-inline">subjectivity</strong>, using the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">df[(df['polarity'] &gt; 0.2) &amp; (df['subjectivity'] &lt; 0.5)]</p>
			<p>This code will show us snippets of positive reviews, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>. We can see that customers are happy about speed, particularly for gaming, but interestingly enough, even positive reviews complain about the range, such as one review that says simply <strong class="bold">Good short range</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.3_B17967.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – A snippet of positive wireless router product reviews&#13;&#10;" width="945" height="290"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – A snippet of positive wireless router product reviews</p>
			<p>These reviews alone show some valuable insights about the router, namely that the consumers like the speed, but complain about the range. Since these reviews are about a 5G wireless<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> router, we can hypothesize that both of these points are related to the nature of 5G, which is incredibly fast, but has notoriously poor range.</p>
			<p>This can<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> inform us about a number of possible decisions. For example, the range of 5G routers can be improved simply by adjusting the placement and orientation of the router. Many consumers aren't aware of this, so product teams could use the insights from these reviews to add that information to the product manual, or even change the way the product is photographed to highlight proper router placement.</p>
			<p>Additionally, these insights can help inform future product development efforts to prioritize improved range, such as by building more powerful antennas. The wireless networking firm could even build a complementary product, such as a range extender.</p>
			<p>Companies today are using virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa as sources of competitive intelligence – learning about what customers want before launching any new service or offering in order to increase market share and differentiate their offerings from competitors' offerings. For instance, one could analyze how often these digital assistants are used on various networks, potentially highlighting specific features that customers may like and will also use on a network, such as the ability to stream video.</p>
			<p>If you're not already doing so, take stock of your company's current level of competitive intelligence-gathering efforts and consider how you might integrate real-time customer data into your existing processes – this will give you even more insight into how customers are interacting with your brand today (and perhaps tomorrow).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Using Commerce.AI for wireless networking brands</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>wireless networking industry is one<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> of the most mature, yet dynamic, sectors today. From smartphones to IoT devices, and from smart homes to self-driving cars, everyone relies on wireless technology for communication and connectivity.</p>
			<p>Wireless networking brands are in the business of connecting people – and that's a big opportunity. Consumers want to use their favorite brands across multiple platforms – <em class="italic">so how can connectivity brands create value for customers? How can they capitalize on this massive opportunity?</em> In the following sections, we'll explore how brands can answer these questions with data-driven solutions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Enter data-driven solutions</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> role of data-driven solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> in the wireless networking industry has evolved tremendously since 2020. At the turn of the century, only a tiny minority of consumers had access to online retail sites. Today, over 90% of all US consumers have made a purchase online (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%2091%25%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s,only%20ones%20who%20shop%20online.">https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=That's%2091%25%20of%20the%20country's,only%20ones%20who%20shop%20online</a>).</p>
			<p>With so much consumer demand for connectivity products and services, brands must leverage data analytics if they want to stay competitive.</p>
			<p>Brands can do this by harnessing machine learning algorithms and complex math models in order to uncover patterns in large datasets where humans might not see them otherwise. They work behind the scenes, crunching numbers that help businesses make smarter decisions that then lead to tangible outcomes such as new product launches or improved customer engagement rates.</p>
			<p>Let's look at how brands can use Commerce.AI's machine learning algorithms and data engine to improve <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>their <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>). Commerce.AI has built the world's largest product data engine, which has analyzed over a trillion data points from sources such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, and even YouTube video reviews and voice surveys.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Prediction</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> the ability to infer trends from data that may or may not be reflected in present trends. The more data you have, the better your prediction capabilities. In this way, a data engine can help acquire and manage product data in a more strategic and proactive manner that can help increase profitability.</p>
			<p>In particular, brands can implement <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>machine learning models to predict and optimize a number of important KPIs, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.4</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_5.4_B17967.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Important KPIs for product teams&#13;&#10;" width="1026" height="336"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Important KPIs for product teams</p>
			<p>Let's look at each of these KPIs in detail to understand why they're important for product teams to consider, analyze, and optimize.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Star ratings</h2>
			<p>The importance <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>of maintaining or increasing customer satisfaction ratings cannot be overstated. Brands that fail to do so are at risk of losing customers and, ultimately, revenue.</p>
			<p>Today, more<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> than ever, consumers want to know what they're getting for their money. For many people, the most important aspect of a purchase is the value received in return for their hard-earned cash. This means that brands need to ensure that each and every transaction with a customer is a positive experience – and not just when it comes time to make a purchase but also throughout the entire customer life cycle.</p>
			<p>This starts with ensuring that product quality and service meet or exceed customer expectations when making initial contact with the brand and continuing through all stages of the relationship with customers (for example, from initial contact through repeat business).</p>
			<p>Remaining competitive in today's highly saturated marketplace requires strong focus on acquiring new customers while retaining existing ones too; our analysis indicates that negative feedback posted online by unhappy customers can have serious implications for companies' bottom lines (<em class="italic">in other words: don't ignore negative reviews!</em>).</p>
			<p>Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for people to voice concerns online about products or services they have purchased. This allows them to voice any concerns they may have regarding purchases made through competing vendors (or even past purchases from the same vendor).</p>
			<p>Importantly <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>though, it also allows them to provide feedback directly related to these previous experiences too – such as poor product quality or shoddy customer service delivery when compared against similar products/services offered by competing vendors/brands.</p>
			<p>And given <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>how heavily relied upon consumer recommendations are today when making purchasing decisions, negative online reviews can prove decisive when it comes time for consumers to make purchase decisions.</p>
			<p>With Commerce.AI, product teams can analyze reviews, the reasons behind reviews, and trends in reviews across virtually all product sources, helping to inform new product innovation, marketing, and customer support efforts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Improving best sellers ranking</h2>
			<p>Best sellers ranking is<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> simply a<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> list of the top-selling products on a given site. It is an important metric for retailers because it indicates which products are popular and which ones to stock more of or sell out faster when they're running low.</p>
			<p>In other <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>words, it indicates which products retailers should be selling more of or focusing on driving higher sales for. In fact, many retailers have dedicated resources to manage their best seller's strategy – and even create new best sellers – as part of their overall business strategy and operations teams.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">So how does one determine what's working and what isn't when it comes to driving sales?</em> By analyzing sales data over time – both historical and real-time – and identifying trends that can be leveraged to improve performance in the future.</p>
			<p>Historical analysis helps define patterns by looking at previous periods (for example, last year, last quarter) when certain events occurred (for example, an event occurred such as an economic recession). This provides valuable insight into what worked before – and often provides clues about what may work going forward too.</p>
			<p>Real-time analysis looks at factors such as clickstream data, visitor behavior, and mouseover actions taken, along with other metrics, such as conversion rates from sign-ups through email campaigns or website forms.</p>
			<p>Simply put, analytics – both historical and real-time – helps you identify trends that can be used to<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> inform your marketing efforts going forward so you can drive more conversions, higher <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>sales, increased revenue, and greater profitability with your product portfolio.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Time compiling weekly reports</h2>
			<p>Leading <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>wireless network brands have approached Commerce.AI for help with their reporting process. Since<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> large wireless networking brands have more than 100 products and services across multiple verticals, they find it <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>difficult to stay on top of what's going on across all of their initiatives and businesses – and even within their own departments.</p>
			<p>One reason for this was that they'd been using spreadsheets and word processing programs to create their detailed KPI reports, which meant that they had to hire additional team members just to maintain these reports – a costly endeavor.</p>
			<p>With so many products and services under different management groups across multiple verticals, it also proves difficult to share and communicate information about what is happening in various areas.</p>
			<p>By automating reporting using AI-powered tools, our clients are able to eliminate the need for dedicated staff just to maintain spreadsheets. Via dynamic visualizations that show patterns in performance across multiple products and services from a variety of angles, clients can spot trends much earlier than before (plus it saves money on HR costs).</p>
			<p>This enables clients not only to take action in real time but also to identify trends earlier than ever before so that they can proactively manage risk and make informed decisions about growth opportunities rather than reacting after something has gone wrong.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Improving product sentiment</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Sentiment analysis</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>form <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>of machine learning that can determine the overall tone and sentiment of a piece of text or an entire product's reviews. It's used to understand what people are saying about brands, products, and services on social media – and then take action accordingly.</p>
			<p>For example, if <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>customers are expressing positive sentiments about a particular product or service on social media, it could be an indicator that they will likely buy this product in-store as well (if the brand has a brick-and-mortar presence). On the other hand, negative sentiments could indicate that the brand should consider improving its product or service offering.</p>
			<p>In the past, wireless networking brands would have relied on qualitative customer experience research (such as in-person interviews), but now they have access to a wealth of data – and it's all about people's online experience with their products and services.</p>
			<p>By using AI technology, these brands are now able to gain actionable insights from their massive amounts of product sentiment data that were previously unavailable. Let's take a closer look at how this works.</p>
			<h3>Machine learning</h3>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> data engine processes vast amounts of unstructured text data (such as reviews and comments) to identify patterns and trends. It then uses those insights to inform future decisions.</p>
			<p>For example, based on the latest reviews posted about a particular product or service, the AI engine can determine which aspects need improvement and then suggest ways for manufacturers to improve them – such as improving the speed of shipping or developing new features in the product itself. <em class="italic">This is machine learning in action!</em></p>
			<h3>Data mining</h3>
			<p>Before AI could <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>be used effectively by wireless networking brands, they needed to be able to process massive amounts of text data (that is, review posts). They also needed tools that could mine their vast stores of such information quickly and efficiently so that they could spot trends and perform sentiment analysis on an ongoing basis.</p>
			<p>That's where <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>Commerce.AI comes in. We provide them with a cloud-based platform that allows them to easily manage large volumes of textual information – and provides real-time insight into what customers are saying about their products and services on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and so on.</p>
			<p>So far this year, we've seen some impressive growth from our wireless networking vertical clients, who are using AI technology in ways that were not possible even just a couple of years ago, given the tremendous growth in wireless networking data amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
			<h3>Actionable insights</h3>
			<p>Once wireless <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>networking brands have enough meaningful insights from their product sentiment analysis, they can use this information to improve their products or services accordingly – and make sure that customers are happy when it comes time for repeat purchases. This is another important benefit of using AI technology for product sentiment analysis – it helps manufacturers create more meaningful customer experiences than ever before.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Improving product conversion</h2>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>product conversion rate measures the percentage of visitors who make a purchase after visiting a website. The <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>more traffic you get to your e-commerce website, the higher your product conversion rate will be. This<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> metric is important for e-commerce retailers, because it shows how well they are converting visitors into customers.</p>
			<p>By looking at site traffic and purchase metrics, we are able to figure out what factors correlated with higher or lower conversions on product sites, and highlight the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Product categories where there was high engagement</li>
				<li>Product subcategories where people spent more time researching before buying (for example, desktop computers)</li>
				<li>Product pricing pages where people had conversations about pricing strategy before making a purchase decision (for example, laptops over $700).</li>
				<li>Product<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> reviews where people compared prices between competing products and then made their purchase decision (for example, laptops under $500)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Search result ranking</h2>
			<p>In a nutshell, <strong class="bold">search result ranking</strong> is based <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>on an algorithm that determines the order in which results are displayed when a user performs a search on a website.</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> importance<a id="_idIndexMarker246"/> of search result ranking cannot be overstated. In fact, it's one of the most important factors determining whether or not a consumer will click on an ad or purchase a product. Consumers are more likely to convert on high-ranking results than organic or paid products from companies that appear lower in their searches.</p>
			<p>This is because people tend to trust sources they see higher up in search results. So clearly, there's value for brands in optimizing their position in search results. <em class="italic">But how can data and AI help?</em></p>
			<p>The data engine behind Commerce.AI compiles a wealth of information on brands, including their performance in search results over time. This enables us to predict the likelihood that a brand will appear higher or lower in search results, as well as its overall ranking.</p>
			<p>Analyzing data from previous searches helps wireless networking brands optimize their position based on actual performance and not just guesswork or hunches. In other words, it allows them to improve their chances of appearing higher in search results by investing in<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> activities (such as content marketing) that help improve brand affinity and increase <strong class="bold">click-through rates</strong> (<strong class="bold">CTR</strong>).</p>
			<p>By using data from previous searches, they can also identify patterns and trends that give them insight into what works and what doesn't work when optimizing for search result ranking. For example, if traffic to a website is low but the CTR for ads on that site is high, there's a good chance the company has done something right with regards to optimizing for CTR.</p>
			<p>On the other <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>hand, if traffic to a website is high but CTR for ads on that site is low, there's probably an issue with ad copy or relevance of product listings that should be addressed before moving forward with any investment in improving CTR further (that is, by ensuring relevant product listings are included).</p>
			<p>By identifying<a id="_idIndexMarker249"/> such issues at an early stage rather than waiting until things go wrong (that is, after spending money on increased visibility), wireless networking brands can save themselves time and money while still achieving their desired outcomes – higher rankings – without compromising their brand values or integrity (in terms of ad copy/relevance).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Detail page glance views</h2>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>start by defining <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>what we mean by a detail page glance view: the number of times an Amazon product detail page is viewed during a defined period (for example, 1 day). This metric has become increasingly important as it reveals patterns in how users interact with products on Amazon – and where there are opportunities for growth.</p>
			<p>In the case of <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>wireless networking brands such as TP-Link, Netgear, and Linksys that sell Wi-Fi routers and related hardware, the ability to track these metrics provides insights into how consumers are interacting with their products on Amazon. It can also provide valuable information about which elements of a product detail page should be optimized in order to improve CTR, conversion rates, and overall sales volume.</p>
			<p>The importance of this data cannot be overstated for any brand or business that sells goods or services online via e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon. In fact, it's so critical that many major brands have dedicated entire teams to monitor it. In our experience working with multiple brands on online retail optimization, having visibility into these metrics has been critical in helping them determine which elements of their products they should prioritize when creating new versions of those items for sale on Amazon.</p>
			<p>It goes without saying that no retailer wants to spend time and resources creating new versions of an item only for it to fall short in the market. Those problems could have been easily <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>avoided had retailers been able to track how many times consumers viewed each version during a given period (that is, glance view data).</p>
