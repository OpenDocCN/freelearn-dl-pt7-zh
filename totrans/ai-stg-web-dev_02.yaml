    predictions made by the model out of the total predictions. In other words, it
    is the number of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number
    of cases. Although useful for getting a general sense of the model’s performance,
    accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, where one class is much more
    prevalent than others.

    various aspects of web development. In this section, we will explore the significance
    of neural networks, their potential outcomes, and their relationship with the
    principles and foundations of web development. Let us dive into some specific
    examples to understand how neural networks can be applied in the context of web
    development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    constitutes inputs. In the context of web development, these inputs can include
    a wide range of user actions, such as mouse movements across the screen, clicks
    on specific elements, or information entered into forms. When we introduce these
    kinds of user interactions into a neural network as inputs, it enables the network
    to analyze and identify patterns within these actions. Through this analysis,
    the neural network can be trained to anticipate user behaviors or preferences
    based on their interaction history with the website. For example, by analyzing
    the browsing patterns of a user, a neural network might be able to foresee the
    types of products or content that would appeal to them, thereby allowing for a
    more customized and engaging user experience on the website by tailoring content
    and recommendations specifically to their interests. Neurons are the building
    blocks of neural networks, and they are responsible for processing and transmitting
    information. In web development, neurons can be analogous to different components
    within a web application. For example, a neuron could represent a specific feature
    or functionality, such as a search bar or a recommendation system. By combining
    and connecting these neurons, we can create complex neural networks that can perform

    layers can be compared to different stages or components of a web application’s
    architecture. Each layer in a neural network extracts and processes specific features
    from the input data. For instance, in a web-based image recognition system, the
    first layer might extract basic features such as edges and colors, while subsequent
    layers could identify more complex patterns such as objects or faces. By organizing
    the layers effectively, we can build powerful neural networks that can handle

    such as the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth are extracted to uniquely identify
    individuals. Feature extraction techniques can vary depending on the task and
    may involve methods such as edge detection, texture analysis, or shape recognition.
    For instance, a travel website can extract key features from destination images,
    such as landmarks or natural attractions, to improve search accuracy. This enables
    users to find their desired travel destinations more efficiently.'

    between objects in an image. This concept is crucial for understanding complex
    scenes and extracting meaningful information. For example, in autonomous driving
    systems, scene understanding is crucial to identify and react to traffic signs,
    pedestrians, and other vehicles. By interpreting the context of a scene, a real
    estate website can provide virtual tours of properties, allowing potential buyers
