- en: It’s hard to come across anyone that doesn’t have strong opinions and reactions
    about AI these days. I’ve witnessed my own feelings and conclusions about it ebb
    and flow as the years have gone on. When I was a student, I felt a tremendous
    amount of excitement and optimism about where AI, and the fourth industrial revolution
    that accompanies it, would take us. That was quickly tempered when I started my
    book club, and I started a monthly practice of reading books about how bias and
    dependence on AI were compromising our lives in seen and unseen ways. Then, I
    started moderating events, where I brought together people from virtually every
    corner of AI and machine learning, who spoke not just on how they’re leveraging
    this technology in their own work but on their own beliefs about how AI will impact
    us in the future.

- en: This brings us to one of the greatest debates we find ourselves returning to
    with every major advancement in technology. Do we dare adopt powerful technology
    even when we’re aware of the risks? As far as I see it, we don’t have a choice,
    and the debate is only an illusion we indulge ourselves in. AI is here to stay,
    and nihilistic fears about it won’t save us from any harm it may cause. Pandora’s
    box is open, and as we peer into what remains of it, we find that hope springs
    eternal.

    a flattering reflection. It’s my hope that, with time, we will learn how to adopt
    AI responsibly in order to minimize its harm and optimize its greatest contributions
    to our modern civilization. I wanted to write a book about AI product management
    because it’s the makers of products that bring nebulous ideas into the “real”
    world. Getting into the details about how to ideate, build, manage and maintain
    AI products with integrity, to the best of my ability, is the greatest contribution
    I can make to this field at this present moment. It’s been an honor to write this
    book.

- en: This book is for people that aspire to be AI product managers, AI technologists,
    and entrepreneurs, or for people that are casually interested in the considerations
    of bringing AI products to life. It should serve you if you’re already working
    in product management and you have a curiosity about building AI products. It
    should also serve you if you already work in AI development in some capacity and
    you’re looking to bring those concepts into the discipline of product management
    and adopt a more business-oriented role. While some chapters in the book are more
    technically focused, all of the technical content in the book can be considered
    beginner level and accessible to all.
