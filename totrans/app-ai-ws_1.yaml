    (AI), which are the foundations of various fields of AI. You will also come across
    different algorithms, including MinMax and A*, through simple coding exercises
    using the Python programming language. You will also be implementing your first
    AI through a simple tic-tac-toe game where you will be teaching the program how
    to win against a human player. By the end of this chapter, you will learn how
    to use popular Python libraries to develop intelligent AI-driven programs.

    is said to learn from experience, **E**, with respect to a task, **T**, and a
    performance measure, **P**, if its performance on **T**, as measured by **P**,
    improves with experience, **E**. This can be translated as what a computer program
    requires in order for it to be learning. We can see **E** (the experience) as
    the data that needs to be fed to the machine, **T**, as the type of decision that
    the machine needs to perform, and **P** as the measure of its performance.

  zh: 他还提出了一个更正式的定义，即计算机程序如果在任务**T**上，通过性能度量**P**衡量后，其在**T**上的表现随着经验**E**的积累而改进，那么可以说它在从经验中学习。这可以转化为计算机程序需要什么才能被认为是在学习。我们可以将**E**（经验）理解为需要输入给机器的数据，**T**作为机器需要执行的决策类型，而**P**则是衡量其表现的标准。

    to achieve AI. However, you can have AI without machine learning. For instance,

    can create an AI agent, even though your approach has little to do with machine
    learning.

    sense the current state of the game through its sensors and can evaluate the potential
    steps. Once the agent finds the best possible step, it performs the action using
    its actuators. The agent finds the best possible action to reach the goal based
    on the information it has. Actions are either rewarded or punished. The carrot
    and stick are excellent examples of rewards and punishment. Imagine a donkey in
    front of your cart. You put a carrot in front of the eyes of the donkey, so the
    animal starts walking toward it. As soon as the donkey stops, the rider may apply
    punishment with a stick. This is not a human way of moving, but rewards and punishment
    control living organisms to some extent. The same happens to humans at school,
    at work, and in everyday life as well. Instead of carrots and sticks, we have
    income and legal punishment to shape our behavior.

    be to take the coordinates between the current state (position) and the goal (destination)
    and calculate the distance between these two points. The distance between two

    abilities such as to listen, speak, understand language, store and retrieve information,
    think, see, and move.

    with the environment, solving a problem in a seemingly intelligent way to pursue
    a goal.

- en: Then, we introduced Python and learned about its role in AI. We looked at a
    few important Python libraries for developing AI and prepared data for the intelligent
    agents. We then created a tic-tac-toe game based on predefined rules. We quantified
    these rules into a number, a process that we call heuristics. We learned how to
    use heuristics in the A* search algorithm to find an optimal solution to a problem.

    AI could win two-player games. In the next chapter, you will be introduced to
    regression.
