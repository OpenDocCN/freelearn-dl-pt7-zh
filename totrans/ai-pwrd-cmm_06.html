			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Chapter 4</em>: Applying AI for Innovation â€“ Luxury Goods Deep Dive</h1>
			<p>Luxury goods are associated with exclusivity and prestige, which makes product development particularly tough. There's a far smaller, more exclusive market of people to target, and traditional methods of market research, such as focus groups, fall short in luxury markets, which are largely made up of <strong class="bold">high-net-worth individuals</strong> (<strong class="bold">HNWIs</strong>).</p>
			<p>Moreover, the value of a luxury goods company comes largely from its brand, so analyzing brand data is of special importance. At the same time, luxury brands naturally have far fewer customers than mass-market brands, which means that getting that data through normal means proves to be a real challenge.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you'll learn about the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the challenges of luxury brands</li>
				<li>Understanding the data extraction process</li>
				<li>Using Commerce.AI for luxury brands</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whether or not you're operating in the luxury market, this chapter will give you insights into how specific brands operate, the challenges they face, and how they overcome them with data and AI, which has broad importance for any brand seeking a competitive advantage.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Understanding the challenges of luxury brands</h1>
			<p>Luxury brands <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>stand out from other competitors because of their high prices: they command higher margins than mass-market rivals due to higher brand equity. They also offer distinctive aesthetic experiences that go beyond mere functionality: beautiful clothing or jewelry that is designed to convey a desirable image for consumers (and hence, raise brand equity).</p>
			<p>These attractive products appeal to customers' aspirations for style and status. The typical consumer perceives luxury goods as just above their budget range but still within their reach and, therefore, desirable as a status symbol, as long as the brand successfully maintains its image. As a result, brand management is of unparalleled importance for luxury brands.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Brand management</h2>
			<p>While damage<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> to one's business reputation is harmful in any industry, this is particularly the case for luxury brands, where brand image is the make-or-break quality of the business.</p>
			<p>For example, the vast majority (78%) of Chinese consumers will buy or boycott a brand solely because of its position on a societal issue, as revealed by the <em class="italic">2018 Edelman Earned Brand </em>survey.</p>
			<p>Brands that fail to collect, analyze, and act on consumer data will inevitably run into anti-brand sentiment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Increasing competition</h2>
			<p>Another key <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>challenge is that the luxury market is highly competitive, with many players fighting for the same customers. This makes it very difficult for luxury brands to differentiate themselves from one another.</p>
			<p>In order to stand out from their competitors and maintain their brand equity, luxury brands need to attract and retain customers through a comprehensive understanding of the customer experience. This is especially true in the context of online channels, where customers have the ability to compare products and services across multiple channels and sources.</p>
			<p>The term <em class="italic">luxury</em> has become increasingly popular over the past decade, as consumers have become more willing to pay for products with higher prices. As wealth increases around the world, demand for luxury goods has been growing steadily too.</p>
			<p>While most Americans still prefer cheaper products (such as grocery store brands), wealthy consumers are showing an increasing preference toward premium products such as Birkin bags from Hermes or key chain necklaces from Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p>
			<p>The growth of luxury markets can be traced back through centuries of economic development. During the Roman Empire, when people were wealthier than ever before, they spent more on food and wine than ever; during this time period, winemaking became highly developed as a result of increased demand for fine wines.</p>
			<p>At the end of World War II, there was a similar increase in demand for fine suits and other clothing due to mass production techniques used by American factories during wartime needs being applied to civilian industries such as clothing manufacturing.</p>
			<p>Today's rapid growth in wealth can be traced back even further than that: many historians believe that it was during prehistoric times when humans first started trading valuable items with each other based on perceived value rather than actual value (such as shells or stones).</p>
			<p>In short, the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>luxury market has a very old history, but it has only more recently truly taken off, resulting in stiff competition.</p>
			<h3>Growth is driving competition</h3>
			<p>The luxury market is a $300 billion industry that includes everything from handbags to yachts, and it's growing at a rapid pace (<a href="https://www.statista.com/study/61582/in-depth-luxury/">https://www.statista.com/study/61582/in-depth-luxury/</a>). And this growth isn't expected to slow down anytime soon: according to Statista, global luxury goods sales are expected to grow by 5.4 percent per year, reaching nearly $400 billion by 2025.</p>
			<p>This growth has been fueled by several factors, including rising wealth around the world and mass manufacturing techniques that have made it easier for companies to produce products with a high profit margin.</p>
			<p>But perhaps the biggest driver of this growth is social media. As consumers increasingly turn to social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram for fashion inspiration, brands have been able to use these platforms as marketing tools. They can post photos of their latest creations on these sites and get them seen by millions of people who could potentially become customers.</p>
			<p>Social media has also helped brands reach out to younger generations who are less likely than older generations to frequent traditional retail stores or visit physical boutiques. Instead, they prefer shopping online or via mobile apps, where they can see more product<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> options at once and compare prices easily without having to physically visit a store first.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Social media management</h2>
			<p>Because of<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> this shift toward online shopping, many luxury retailers have had trouble keeping up with demand for their products as shoppers increasingly seek out cheaper alternatives online instead of paying top dollar for designer goods in physical stores or boutiques.</p>
			<p>This means there's plenty of room for new players in the luxury market who don't necessarily need deep pockets but do have an eye for design and know how to use social media effectively as marketing tools.</p>
			<p>The luxury market is a tough one for any brand to crack. It's not just that the products are expensive, but that they also have a reputation for being ostentatious and frivolous. That means luxury brands must walk a fine line between appearing exclusive and appearing tacky. And it's not easy, with many luxury socks, for instance, costing thousands of dollars.</p>
			<p>But there are some ways in which luxury brands can be more successful than their mass counterparts on social media. For example, they tend to have more sophisticated strategies for managing their online reputations and building relationships with customers. They also have access to data about their customers that other companies don't, allowing them to personalize marketing campaigns and engage with customers in new ways.</p>
			<p>Let's take a closer look at how these strategies work and what makes them so effective. Luxury brands tend to do two things on social media: they post photos of beautiful products or events, and they share stories about the people who wear those products or attend those events.</p>
			<p>This strategy is similar to how many mass retailers use Instagram: post photos of your latest sale items, and then tag them with relevant hashtags so your followers can find them easily when browsing through their feed.</p>
			<p>But this approach has its limits: luxury brands can only reach so many qualified leads through generic social media posts; if you want your followers to find your posts organically (that is, without following you specifically), you need to make sure those posts get seen<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> by as many people as possible.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Matching eccentric customer preferences</h2>
			<p>Luxury brands<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> face many challenges in delivering what customers want. While mass-market brands focus on addressing tangible things such as feature requests, luxury brands must also deal with the intangible.</p>
			<p>The luxury market is very different from the mass market. It's not about what you can see or touch; it's about how you feel and what you think. It's about emotions and feelings. This means that luxury brands must be more creative in their thinking than mass-market brands when it comes to delivering value to customers.</p>
			<p>And this is where things get tricky: <em class="italic">how do you satisfy an emotional need?</em> In other words, <em class="italic">how do you make people feel good?</em> The answer for many luxury brands is that they have to become experts at understanding their customers and then satisfying their needs through storytelling.</p>
			<p>There are some challenges in doing so: one challenge is that we know less about our consumers than we used to because they are becoming more diverse and internationalized.</p>
			<p>We don't know who they are or where they come from; <em class="italic">we don't even know if they exist! So how do we reach them? How do we find them? How do we engage with them? What kind of information should we collect from them? How can we use this information to create better products and services for them?</em></p>
			<p>This means that luxury brands have to rely on customer research more than ever before, which can be difficult when customers aren't willing to share much information.</p>
			<p>As a result, these companies often turn to celebrities as brand ambassadors instead of relying on traditional surveys and focus groups. But while celebrity endorsements may seem like a simple solution for luxury companies looking for ways to connect with customers, there are some risks involved here too: for one thing, celebrities tend not to be representative of the general population, so using them as spokespeople could alienate potential customers who don't look like Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian.</p>
			<p>Celebrity endorsements also carry a lot of baggage around image issues, which could hurt the brand overall if the celebrity endorser ends up tarnishing its reputation over time.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">So, what does all this mean for luxury consumers?</em> It means that luxury consumers will continue spending money on experiences rather than tangible goods. They want something unique and memorable rather than something ordinary and cheap. They want something exclusive rather than something common and available everywhere else, and they want something personal.</p>
			<p>They want stories instead of statistics; anecdotes instead of datasheets; inspiration instead of practical advice; romance instead of sex appeal; mystery instead of transparency; magic instead of logic; dreams instead of reality checks; surprises instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>predictability; adventure rather than security; and fantasy rather than practicality.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Understanding unique customer profiles</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>challenges of luxury brands include understanding unique customer profiles. Let's explore four unique luxury customer profiles in detail, and the implications of these different profiles on product innovation: <strong class="bold">patricians</strong>, <strong class="bold">parvenus</strong>, <strong class="bold">poseurs</strong>, and <strong class="bold">proletariat</strong>.</p>
			<p>These four wealthy consumer profiles were categorized in a famous <em class="italic">Wall Street Journal</em> article from 2010, titled <em class="italic">The Four Species of Wealthy Consumers</em>.</p>
			<h3>Patricians</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">patrician</strong> customer <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>profile is<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> a heritage category, which means they have money to burn. They want luxury brands to be different and stand out in their own way. In other words, to target patricians, brands need to create <em class="italic">distinctions worth bragging about</em>.</p>
			<p>At the same time, they don't want things that are too flashy or aggressive because those may attract unwanted attention. What they do want is something that is distinctive and exclusive without being ostentatious or brash.</p>
			<p>In other words, patricians are more interested in the iconic than the ephemeral. While trendsetting designs are often ostentatious, iconic designs are largely more subtle, enabling them to stand the test of time and changing consumer tastes.</p>
			<p>This understanding is crucial for product innovation because if your target market consists largely of patricians, creating ephemeral designs will result in failure. Instead, you'll want to learn from iconic products and innovate luxury concepts that push the envelope <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>while maintaining class and <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>delightful <em class="italic">understatedness</em>.</p>
			<h3>Parvenus</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Parvenus</strong> are seen<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> as relatively uncouth <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>status seekers who spend lavishly on status goods such as glittery apparel, shiny cars, and gold watches. They are willing to pay a premium for the best because they are focused on their own status symbol: <em class="italic">what I wear defines me</em>.</p>
			<p>In fact, this is true of all luxury consumers; however, parvenus have a unique focus on what others think of them. Therefore, they will often look to emulate celebrities (or people whom they perceive as celebrities) rather than achieving status through accomplishments.</p>
			<p>As a result, parvenus tend to emphasize youth in their physical appearance; they want to be young forever. They also desire products that convey youthfulness and energy. The result is that fashion brands targeting this class frequently use celebrity endorsements and catwalk shows to project youth and energy into parvenu shoppers' consciousnesses.</p>
			<p>The upshot is that parvenus lack patience; they expect immediate gratification from luxury purchases even if the benefits do not materialize immediately. That said, once these consumers make a purchase, they do tend to be loyal customers because once given a taste of luxury, many parvenus cannot resist returning for more.</p>
			<h3>Poseurs</h3>
			<p><em class="italic">How do you market to poseurs?</em> A <strong class="bold">poseur</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>a person who wants to wear luxury goods, but <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>often can't afford the real thing, so they spend outside their budget, acquire knock-offs, or buy the <em class="italic">#3</em> or <em class="italic">#4</em> brand instead of the market leader.</p>
			<p>They want designer labels at bargain prices. And they have short memories. It is a little like marketing for a diet product: people know that diets largely don't work, so when you tell them they can eat what they love again, it doesn't matter if it has artificial sugars or preservatives or whatever else in it; all that matters is that it tastes good.</p>
			<p>But there's also another side to this phenomenon: brands create items that let these people feel like they belong among the privileged elite without actually buying into their lifestyle and values.</p>
			<p>This is how there are luxury goods so universally beloved by poseurs, because they signal ostentatious wealth even though their quality is generally poor compared with authentic luxury items.</p>
			<p>To most luxury consumers, the use of knock-offs would be an insult; however, these kinds of fakes have gained enough interest within certain circles that some genuine fashion <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>houses now authorize them to make <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>replicas for exclusive sale only at certain stores around the world.</p>
			<h3>Proletariat</h3>
			<p>Finally, the <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>proletariat are customers <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>who are less affluent but status conscious. These customers have a strong need to demonstrate their social position and wealth in order to feel comfortable in their social circles and at work. They do so by showing off their homes, clothes, cars, watches, and so on.</p>
			<p>In other words, those who have not reached the higher rungs of the economic ladder still continue to follow consumerist values of conspicuous consumption in order to maintain a sense of status quo with regard to their place in society.</p>
			<p>In short, traditional marketing, product development, and brand management fall short for luxury brands, which face a unique set of challenges, given their unique target market.</p>
			<p>Let's explore how analyzing product data can help luxury brands overcome these challenges.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Understanding the data extraction process</h1>
			<p>A lot of these <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>companies use AI to predict what consumers want. They use data to understand how consumers actually behave and then use that information to shape the products they make, sell, and market. These companies have figured out how to use data in a way that provides massive value for their<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> customers. The following examples demonstrate this in action.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Tumi uses AI for better marketing</h2>
			<p>Tumi is a<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> manufacturer of high-end suitcases and bags for travel. Brands in this market segment are often stuck with boring marketing strategies centered around all-too-typical tactics such as flash sales and promo codes.</p>
			<p>Tumi, in contrast, has used AI to personalize messages in its outbound marketing and smarten its digital ads strategy by targeting customers with the highest predicted lifetime value. The majority of Tumi's marketing revenue comes from its email campaigns, so improving emails with personalization was a clear way to boost the bottom line.</p>
			<p>Given data such as recent browser behavior, email open rates, and search behavior, in addition to past purchases, machine learning models can accurately predict what a customer is most likely to buy, and when. By presenting those recommendations, Tumi was able to increase sales with fewer outbound messages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Burberry uses AI to improve its clothes</h2>
			<p>Burberry is <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>famous for its leather trench coats, cashmere scarves, and other luxurious designs. However, creating new styles for each season isn't easy, as it takes months for designers to create new collections based on consumer feedback gathered at stores around the world â€” which meant that stores often got stuck selling old styles all year long instead of offering new ones throughout the year.</p>
			<p>Now, Burberry uses AI to improve its product innovation process, through making better products, faster, cheaper processes, and more insightful analysis.</p>
			<p>This British fashion label also offers data-driven personalized product recommendations, both online and in-store, resulting in a 50 percent increase in repeat purchases by 2015. Additionally, Burberry uses chatbots powered by natural language as a smart <em class="italic">fashion adviser</em>.</p>
			<p>While the exact workings of these fashion advisers are secret, as they are, after all, a valuable intellectual property, we can see how they might work. We can create a simple fashion adviser <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>powered by <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) algorithms <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>using <strong class="bold">GPT-J</strong>.</p>
			<p>GPT-J is a large language model, or a machine learning model that was trained on large amounts of text, released by a group called Eleuther AI. We'll demonstrate it as follows as it's an open source and easily accessible tool:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we can install GPT-J and then import our needed library, like so:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">!pip install gptj</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">from GPTJ.Basic_api import SimpleCompletion</strong></p><p>Just like that, we're ready to use GPT-J. The way that modern large language models <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>work is with a concept <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>called <strong class="bold">pre-training</strong>, which means that the model was already trained on a huge amount of text data and we only need a small amount of data to tune the model for a specific task.</p></li>
				<li>Next, we define this task by providing <strong class="source-inline">prompt</strong>, which includes examples of fashion advice, such as recommending the pairing of a blue denim jacket with golden yellow eyeshadow:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">prompt = "Recommend a fashion item based on a list of clothes item.\n##\nWearing: Floral skirt\nFashion item: Try a black-and-white polkadot shirt for the classic floral and dot combo!\n##\nWearing: Blue denim jacket\nFashion item: Try golden yellow eye-shadow for a warm blue and gold glow!\n##\nWearing: Red lipstick\nFashion item: Pair your red lipstick with a red dress and red heels for a triple threat!\n##\nWearing: " + item + "\nFashion item:"</strong></p><p>This prompt is crucial for the language model because language models have a broad range of use cases, including classification, generation, translation, transformation, and so on. So, they have to be guided to complete specific tasks. Using the <strong class="source-inline">prompt</strong> variable, we can guide the model to act as a fashion adviser.</p></li>
				<li>Further, we'll want to pass a number of parameters, primarily <strong class="source-inline">temperature</strong> (or randomness), <strong class="source-inline">max_length</strong> (or the maximum output size of the model), and <strong class="source-inline">item</strong> (or what the user types in, such as <strong class="source-inline">Orange shorts</strong>):<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">temperature = 0.4</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">top_probability = 1.0</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">max_length = 15</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">item = "Orange shorts"</strong></p></li>
				<li>Finally, we can now pass the <strong class="source-inline">prompt</strong> variable and the parameters to the model to create<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> a recommendation. We'll also grab just the first line of text generated, in case the model goes overboard:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">query = SimpleCompletion(prompt, length=max_length, </strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Â Â t=temperature, top=top_probability)</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Query = query.simple_completion()</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">lines = Query.splitlines()</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">results = []</strong></p><p>In doing so, giving the model an input such as <strong class="source-inline">Orange shorts</strong> generates a recommendation such as <strong class="bold">Try a dark blue top and orange heels for a bright pop of color!</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are other ways to try this same concept out even without using any code at all, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>with <strong class="bold">AI21 Studio</strong> (<a href="https://studio.ai21.com">https://studio.ai21.com</a>). In <em class="italic">Figure 4.1</em>, we use the same prompt in a visual canvas instead of code and given the item <strong class="source-inline">Orange shorts</strong>, AI21 Studio recommends we <strong class="bold">Try a floral top and sandals for a cute, summery look!</strong></p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 â€“ The AI21 Studio canvas as a fashion adviser</p>
			<p>As with GPT-J, we'll<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> need to provide a number of settings, which is done in AI21 Studio through a <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> panel.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>The settings, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.2</em>, are almost identical and include maximum completion <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>length, temperature, and stop sequences.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Algorithmic couture</h2>
			<p>Fashion<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> designers Kotaro Sano, Kazuya Kawasaki, and <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>machine learning engineer Yusuke Fujihira teamed up to create <strong class="bold">algorithmic couture</strong>.</p>
			<p>Machine learning was used to learn from massive amounts of product data, particularly fashion images, and generated optimized fashion pattern modules.</p>
			<p>Using computer-aided design software, the team could then model new fashion designs that would be both zero waste and comfortable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>AI runways</h2>
			<p>Another popular<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> AI fashion use case is in generating<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> runway shows.</p>
			<p>AI artist Robbie Barat has worked on an AI-generated Balenciaga runway show with the help of a neural network trained on past collections of the fashion brand Acne Studios.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>RefaceAI</h2>
			<p>AI is also <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>used<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> on the consumer and marketing side of fashion by using <strong class="bold">deepfake technology</strong> to place consumers in the content of brands.</p>
			<p>The RefaceAI app, for instance, swaps the user into branded videos. They've generated over a million <em class="italic">refaces</em> and have gained 400,000 shares in a day during a test collaboration with Gucci.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Zalando</h2>
			<p>Zalando <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>Research is<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> an online retailer in Europe and the United Kingdom, and they're developing AI software for designers.</p>
			<p>These AI solutions cover the personalization of fit, visual searches for fashion images, determining the diversity of design, fashion purchase recommendations, generative fashion design, and more.</p>
			<p>Given that research advancements in AI fashion are so hot, we can expect the benefits of AI to continue to trickle into the industry for years to come. This is especially true considering the rise of easy-to-use AI for commerce tools, such as Commerce.AI, which we'll explore<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Using Commerce.AI for luxury brands</h1>
			<p>Commerce.AI's<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> solutions <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>help clients gain a competitive advantage by providing them with actionable insights that enable them to make more informed decisions and improve the overall customer experience. This allows brands to connect with their customers in new ways, which in turn drives growth and profitability.</p>
			<p>Let's dive deep into four areas where Commerce.AI is used.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Design and user research</h2>
			<p>Commerce.AI delivers<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> insights into consumer <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>behavior that help companies develop products that are better aligned with changing needs and preferences. Our technology helps brands understand their customers' behavior by learning more about what they buy and how they buy it.</p>
			<p>For example, we can help luxury brands such as Gucci or Burberry understand the preferences of their most valuable customers so they can deliver personalized experiences to those consumers across all touchpoints â€“ from product design to shipping and handling to returns.</p>
			<p>We also help food and beverage companies learn more about the eating habits of their most loyal consumers so they can develop products that appeal to specific segments of their target audience, such as millennials who love sweet flavors but refuse artificial ingredients.</p>
			<p>With this knowledge at hand, businesses can make smarter decisions on where to invest in innovation <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>efforts and how best to reach out to <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>consumers based on behavior uncovered through data analysis.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Product development and marketing</h2>
			<p>Let's say you<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> are a luxury brand that makes<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> handbags or luggage that you sell directly to consumers online or at your retail stores (or both). You have an existing product line that you want to expand into new markets such as China or India where there's huge potential for growth, but your current team doesn't have experience developing products for these markets.</p>
			<p>Going blindly into a new market is a recipe for failure, particularly in the luxury brand industry, where, as we've explored, there are wholly unique customer profiles and preferences to consider. Product data enables a diverse range of insights, depending on the market niche, the brand, the customer profile, and more. As such, Commerce.AI is essentially a <em class="italic">blank slate</em> for brands â€“ a mock-up of which is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em> â€“ which is filled with relevant data for the needs at hand:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 â€“ A mock-up of a Commerce.AI Luxury Goods dashboard</p>
			<p>The first<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> step<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> in this process is helping your team identify which features are most important in these new countries based on insights from industry experts about what customers really value about your products in each country.</p>
			<p>With Commerce.AI's data engine, which has analyzed billions of product data points across geographies worldwide, you can pinpoint how customer sentiment and interests vary in different markets. For example, in <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>, we can see an example of popular brand attributes for a leading clothing brand:</p>

			<p>Popular <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>attributes, or features of <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>products, include mentions of <strong class="bold">fit</strong>, <strong class="bold">color</strong>, and <strong class="bold">zipper</strong>. The <strong class="bold">zipper</strong> attribute is highlighted as a non-obvious trend, because, for instance, customers may have issues with the zipper in particular products. By highlighting popular attributes, AI can help product teams focus on what customers are talking about the most.</p>
			<p>Similarly, once your team has identified the most important product features for each country, it will then be able to create a prioritized list of feature ideas that they can test with actual customers across different geographies, while also validating whether customers actually want these additional features through an online survey tool built into <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>Commerce.AI, called <strong class="bold">voice surveys</strong>.</p>
			<p>Once validated by real users across different geographies using voice surveys, they can then decide which ones make sense to pursue further by creating mock-ups of how those new features might look.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Brand management</h2>
			<p>Commerce.AI helps <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>luxury firms manage their brand in the market.</p>
			<p>It uses machine learning to help companies understand how customers are interacting with their products, what they like about them, and what they don't like about them. The technology can be used to monitor competitors' products and identify new opportunities for growth.</p>
			<p>For example, if you sell watches, Commerce.AI can tell you which watch styles are selling well and which ones aren't. You can then use this information to create more watches of those types or develop new watch designs based on customer feedback.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 4.5</em> shows a mock-up of what these forecasts might look like. While brand-specific data is largely private and therefore cannot be shared here, Commerce.AI users see tremendous value in forecasting brand trends</p>

			<p>Commerce.AI also allows luxury brands to track features that customers want in their products and identify areas where they need improvement. This allows them to respond quickly when customers have issues with their products or request new features through social media or other channels.</p>
			<p>For example, if a customer posts a negative review on Facebook about your watch brand quality, Commerce.AI can notify your brand team so that they can address the issue immediately before it becomes a bigger problem for your brand reputation.</p>
			<p>In addition to helping luxury brands improve their product development process, Commerce.AI also helps them scale communications efforts across all of their channels (social media, email marketing lists, and others) so that they can respond quickly to any customer <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>complaints or questions about their products.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Trend analysis</h2>
			<p>Luxury brands are<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> tasked with leading the way when it comes to status trends, and that means they need to be deeply in tune with the pulse of the luxury market.</p>
			<p>With Commerce.AI's data engine, we've uncovered a number of key trends that have big implications for product innovation, including the rise of second-hand luxury goods, the rise of luxury rentals, and luxury subscriptions. Let's explore these three trends in detail.</p>
			<h3>Second-hand luxury goods</h3>
			<p>Commerce.AI data<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> shows that second-hand sales of luxury goods saw an astonishing rise in the past year, even while luxury sales took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
			<p>As IMARC Group reports, second-hand luxury sales are expected to grow annually at a rate of over 10% in the next 5 years (<a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/secondhand-luxury-goods-market">https://www.imarcgroup.com/secondhand-luxury-goods-market</a>). In other words, the second-hand luxury goods market is growing far faster than its core market counterpart.</p>
			<p>This represents a massive shift in consumer preferences, which is why many brands are innovating to meet these new demands.</p>
			<h3>Luxury rentals</h3>
			<p>The luxury rental<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> space is gaining momentum as luxury consumers become more eco-conscious, and fewer consumers want to purchase a good that they'll only sport once or twice.</p>
			<p>This has created a new demand for rental services across jewelry sets and art collections that can be<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> rented by the night or day for events such as weddings or corporate meetings.</p>
			<h3>Luxury subscriptions</h3>
			<p>Online retail <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>sites have elevated digital subscription models beyond books and music, streaming into other categories such as fashion where you can subscribe to monthly deliveries straight to your door.</p>
			<p>With services such as Birchbox, CURATEUR, and others continuing to gain traction in this space, we expect consumers will become increasingly comfortable with periodic fashion deliveries right into their homes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we've explored how AI has the potential to help luxury brands overcome key product-related challenges, including brand and social media management, meeting eccentric customer preferences, and standing out amid an increasingly competitive market.</p>
			<p>In a traditional product intelligence environment, analysts must manually sort through copious amounts of data to find market opportunities, analyze competitors, and create innovative new products.</p>
			<p>With an AI solution, billions of products data points can be analyzed effortlessly to create a competitive advantage in the luxury market. By understanding challenges and AI-based solutions in the luxury market, you can begin to see how AI can be useful for any product team.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore how to apply AI for innovation in the wireless networking space. As with luxury brands, wireless networking firms face a unique set of product-related challenges, which can be addressed with AI due to its versatile ability to learn from large amounts of product data.</p>
