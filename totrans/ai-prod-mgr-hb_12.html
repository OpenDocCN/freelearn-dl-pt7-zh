			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>Trends and Insights across Industry</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at how the rising tide of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) is affecting companies across the spectrum, as well as the ways AI is affecting companies within their own operations. In this chapter, we will look at the various ways we’re seeing AI trending across industries, through the lens of prominent and respected research organizations, in an effort to inspire product managers and entrepreneurs out there to begin to formulate their strategies by elevating their products into AI products. In addition, we will go over the various considerations they must keep in mind when attempting to approach AI, including AI readiness <span class="No-Break">and enablement.</span></p>
			<p>Analyzing trends and understanding the growth areas for AI and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) adoption can open us up to powerful future opportunities. The nature of what we build and how we work is changing because of this massive shift in adoption. For most of this book, we’ve focused on AI products but we’ve also alluded to the various ways companies will be changing from an operational perspective due to AI. The best advice for companies looking to capitalize on building AI programs to support the products they make is to also use that same program to leverage AI for internal purposes. If you’re investing in this technology, you’ll also want to use it to make internal efficiencies and elevate the performance of <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re in a position to be ready to take your product to the next level by introducing AI/ML capabilities, it means you’ve accepted the responsibility and privilege of supporting such an ambitious endeavor. In this chapter, we’ll be taking a look at what reputable consulting, research, and advisory companies have to say about where the greater opportunities regarding AI adoption lie, as well as looking into the trends coming up in adopting AI in traditional software products. Getting a sense of what’s been showing promise and the kinds of AI adoption that have been substantially improving products is helpful when looking for inspiration for how AI can improve your own <span class="No-Break">existing products.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Highest growth areas – Forrester, Gartner, and <span class="No-Break">McKinsey research</span></li>
				<li>Trends in AI adoption – let the data speak <span class="No-Break">for itself</span></li>
				<li>Low-hanging fruit – quickest wins for <span class="No-Break">AI enablement</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>Highest growth areas – Forrester, Gartner, and McKinsey research</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will be taking a look at some of the growth areas of AI from some of the most prominent research and consulting groups. Understanding what the signals are saying gives us the <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>motivation and foresight to be able to anticipate some of the greatest opportunities that lie ahead. This is particularly helpful in the context of revolutionizing a business or product toward AI because many product managers and technologists may be at odds about which specific areas of a product or service they might want to begin bolstering with <span class="No-Break">AI capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Some of the top growth areas we will look at based on the conglomeration of research and trend analysis from Forrester, Gartner, and McKinsey in the following subsections are embedded AI, ethical AI, creative AI, and autonomous AI development. Embedded AI will look at AI that’s applied and integrated into the operations of organizations and foundations of products. Ethical AI will look at considerations of responsibility and privacy in AI deployment. Creative AI will look at generative and Web3 use cases of AI. Autonomous development will look at the growing field of AI-generated code. All of these are strategic growth areas for AI adoption according to some of the most reputable organizations we have for <span class="No-Break">predicting trends.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s <span class="No-Break">get started!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>Embedded AI – applied and integrated use cases</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Embedded AI</strong> relates to AI being integrated into <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>core operational activities within a business. If your product is geared towards B2B internal processes such as architecture, operations, fulfillment, supply chain, HR, or procurement, you might be interested in bolstering your product with AI features that help companies fulfill their commitments to their consumers. Based on Forrester’s research on 2022 predictions, the more your product can offer real value to your B2B consumers, the more you will be able to help <em class="italic">enterprises shrink the latency between insights, decisions, and results.</em> This area of AI that Forrester refers to as <em class="italic">AI Inside</em> deals with the integration of AI that’s embedded into operations. The ultimate goal is to help inform or even automate <span class="No-Break">decision making.</span></p>
			<p>Often, the most value your product will be able to give your customers is actionable information they can use to make high-level decisions. If your product is dependable in delivering this, it is worth the hassle for companies to invest in their own AI infrastructure to achieve the same results. Gartner outlines this concept in their <em class="italic">applications-centric AI</em> framework, where they consider innovations in engineering, decision intelligence, and operational <span class="No-Break">AI systems.</span></p>
			<p>For Gartner, the focus of this area of AI is toward helping improve decision intelligence overall in order to both reduce the technical debt and visibility for businesses internally, as well as helping reduce the<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> risk and unpredictability of outcomes. In other words, the most impactful part of this area of AI, according to Gartner, is that it helps decision makers have both clarity of their internal processes and make their most important decisions using insights that are derived from their <span class="No-Break">own data.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner also predicts a rise of causal AI, which are systems that identify and act on <em class="italic">“cause-and-effect relationships to go beyond correlation-based predictive models and toward AI systems that can prescribe actions more effectively and act more autonomously.”</em> Gartner has a number of other areas of AI implementation that it refers to in categories such as augmented FinOps, cybersecurity mesh architecture, data observability, and industry cloud platforms, all of which are areas of growth that support the integration of AI internally into enterprise’s business processes. For Gartner, this is perhaps best encapsulated by the Optimize category of their <em class="italic">Top Strategic Technology Trends </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">2023</em></span><span class="No-Break"> report.</span></p>
			<p>This report also includes <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>things such as the <strong class="bold">digital immune system</strong>, a set of practices and technologies that focus on optimized resilience in the face of threats that would impact an organization’s ability to bounce back from any threat to their ability to deliver a customer or user experience. As they see it, this would cover a wide variety of tools that help businesses prepare for potential risks, which learn from past failures to better prepare for the next. Rather than looking at this from a cybersecurity perspective, this would pertain to any internal process that could negatively impact experience and delivery to a customer. The <strong class="bold">applied observability</strong> category also<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> highlights tools that are looking for any deviations within an organization’s operations that would impact core business functions <span class="No-Break">and infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey features <em class="italic">Applied AI</em> as one of their top strategic features in their <em class="italic">Technology Trends Outlook 2022</em> report, which they define as the intelligent application of AI towards solving classification, control, and prediction problems in order to automate, add, or augment business use cases. Some of these use cases are defined in their report as risk management, service operations optimization, and product development. Based on their research, the factors contributing to this include the global expansion of AI adoption, more affordable AI implementation routes, an improvement in training speed, high growth in innovation based on <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>patents filed, and a marked increase in private investment growth for AI-related companies. Their numbers also reflect this in the <em class="italic">Trends in AI </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">adoption</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey goes a step further in isolating the areas of AI that are showing the most noteworthy promise for AI adoption. They list the general umbrella of ML at the top of the list for its use in optimization problems and its ability to learn from data using <span class="No-Break">statistical models.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Computer vision</strong> is listed as<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> the second most noteworthy area for using visual data for facial recognition and biometrics. Third is <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) and its <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>prevalence in speech recognition and virtual voice assistants. Fourth is <strong class="bold">deep reinforcement learning</strong>, specifically for things such as<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> robotics and manufacturing lines. Lastly, they list <strong class="bold">knowledge graphs</strong> for their ability to derive insights from <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>network analysis. We’ve covered most of these major areas of ML extensively in this book, and it’s no surprise to see them echoed in McKinsey’s <em class="italic">Technology Trends Outlook </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">2022</em></span><span class="No-Break"> report.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>Ethical AI – responsibility and privacy</h2>
			<p>Another high growth area for Forrester is the niche of responsible or ethical AI. Thanks to advocacy groups and increasing <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>pressure on lawmakers to define ethical uses of AI moving forward, the area of responsible AI is seeing a boom. AI/ML capabilities will go through increasing waves of regulation because of how pervasive AI has already become in virtually every area of human life, even in these early days. This opens up a lot of opportunities for products and services that already deal with issues of fairness, bias, and governance to then move into the area of governing <span class="No-Break">AI bias.</span></p>
			<p>According to Forrester, the more AI adoption we experience, the more <em class="italic">“existing machine-learning vendors will acquire specialized responsible AI vendors for bias detection, interpretability, and model lineage capabilities.”</em> This is a rosy outlook for companies already operating in this space, as we’re likely to see demand for these kinds of services increase as the next decade <span class="No-Break">moves forward.</span></p>
			<p>Considering our category of embedded and applied AI is the top growth area for AI adoption, we will increasingly experience ML embedded into more and more of the products we use, whether we’re individual consumers or businesses. With the increase in adoption will come an increase in how heavily the use and deployment of ML <span class="No-Break">are scrutinized.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner agrees, going as far as to have their Research VP at Gartner say that <em class="italic">“increased trust, transparency, fairness, and auditability of AI technologies continues to be of growing importance to a wide range of stakeholders. Responsible AI helps achieve fairness, even though biases are baked into the data; gain trust, although transparency and explainability methods are evolving; and ensure regulatory compliance, while grappling with AI’s </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">probabilistic nature.”</em></span></p>
			<p>Among these general comments about AI transparency and fairness, we also see a slew of categories of prediction, including the rise of dynamic risk governance tools, cybersecurity mesh <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>architecture, and cloud sustainability, as well as the rise in decentralized identities and the move toward consumers owning more and more of their digital identity and data as Web3 applications <span class="No-Break">take off.</span></p>
			<p>A recent report by McKinsey also highlights trustworthiness and explainability in applied AI as one of the top considerations when incorporating AI into products. The ability to hedge risks, particularly as AI use cases expand, is of particular concern. Adhering to laws, remaining vigilant on ethics, and building AI with social robustness are their recommendations for building in a way that mitigates harm. They also note that explainability is closely related to this, further highlighting that as models become increasingly complex and are deployed on high-risk use cases, the issue of explainability will <span class="No-Break">remain critical.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey lists explainability as threefold. Explaining how the model actually works is one thing, but they also suggest organizations demonstrate causal explainability, which is about explaining why certain outputs come from the inputs. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is trust-inducing explainability: explaining why you can trust and deploy <span class="No-Break">a model.</span></p>
			<p>Building AI/ML products and upgrading traditional software products into AI products will be a continuous process of reinforcing their trustworthiness, reliability, and safety across multiple areas. It gives me confidence that these three prominent advisory organizations give ethical AI the importance it deserves as we continue to build the future with these <span class="No-Break">powerful tools.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor389"/>Creative AI – generative and immersive applications</h2>
			<p>The area of creative AI is sure to expand further, as we alluded to in previous chapters, with reference to <strong class="bold">Lensa</strong>, <strong class="bold">ChatGPT</strong>, <strong class="bold">DALL-E</strong>, and other creative AI apps that focus on writing, music, and visual arts. According to Forrester, <em class="italic">“CMOs are starting to apply artificial intelligence to digital media buying, campaign automation, or marketing mix optimization.”</em> As a result, use <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>and trust in creative AI applications are growing, and businesses and consumers alike are starting to lean into the creative inspiration AI has <span class="No-Break">to offer.</span></p>
			<p>In 2021, South Africa granted a <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>patent to an AI system called <strong class="bold">DABUS</strong>, created by Stephen Thaler. This opened up a whole new world of AI that now receives legal protections for its own creativity. While the same patent was rejected in the US, Europe, and Australia, it found a haven in South Africa. Forrester believes we will see an increase in legislation supporting creative outputs of AI, as well as an increase in creative AI patents, as these recent events are likely to change public perception. As AI deliverables and outputs continue to be granted legislative recognition, we’re likely to also see an advancement in creative tech companies building more and more AI capabilities into their <span class="No-Break">existing products.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner addresses creative AI in their top strategic technology trends by referring to it as <em class="italic">Generative AI</em>, which they <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>define as <em class="italic">“machine learning methods that learn about content or objects from their data, and use it to generate brand-new, completely original, realistic artifacts.”</em> Gartner predicts a rise in AI-augmented design or the use of ML and NLP to generate and develop not just creative content but to also <em class="italic">“automatically generate and develop user flows, screen designs, content, and presentation-layer code for digital products.”</em> Gartner also takes this idea a step further by forecasting the importance of AI-assisted immersive experiences as one of their top predictors for creative AI, particularly the rise of the metaverse and AI-driven representations that other aspects of Web3 <span class="No-Break">will necessitate.</span></p>
			<p>While McKinsey doesn’t necessarily cover creative AI in their recent trends report, they do cover potential applications of AI toward creative use cases in their <em class="italic">Applied AI</em> category, and they also cite immersive-reality technologies as a key trend for the upcoming decade, which will be supported <span class="No-Break">by AI.</span></p>
			<p>Accounting for areas <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>such as <strong class="bold">spatial computing</strong>, <strong class="bold">mixed reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>), <strong class="bold">augmented reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>), and <strong class="bold">virtual reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">VR</strong>) will all be optimized using AI. McKinsey’s report lists<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> the following areas as strategic use cases for<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> immersive reality solutions: learning and<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> assessment, product design and development, enhanced situational awareness, and B2C use cases such as gaming, fitness, <span class="No-Break">and retail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/>Autonomous AI development – TuringBots</h2>
			<p>Low- and no-code tools have been around for some time now in the hopes of bridging the divide between the technical needs of enterprises and the cost and time needed to onboard a dedicated staff of<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> developers. This is now being <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>pushed a step further with the emergence of what Forrester calls <strong class="bold">TuringBots</strong>, or <em class="italic">bots that write code</em>. If you’re already in this no- or low-code tech space and you’re looking to integrate AI into your product, you’ll likely want to compete with many of the free services out there and offer these capabilities to <span class="No-Break">your customers.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner also predicts this is a major theme in the coming decade and refers to these as <em class="italic">machine learning code generation tools,</em> but the idea here is the same. These would be ML models that would work alongside human developers and would be integrated into development environments in order to offer suggestions on the code base using descriptions in natural language or fragments of code as a prompt. Because of the highly adaptable nature of ML to optimize repetitive tasks, it’s unsurprising that ML is leveraged to optimize the very way <span class="No-Break">it’s built.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner goes on to predict a<a id="_idIndexMarker581"/> rise in what it calls <strong class="bold">Adaptive AI</strong> or systems that <em class="italic">“continuously retrain models and learn within runtime and development environments based on new data to adapt quickly to changes in real-world circumstances that were not foreseen or available during initial development.”</em> This means that AI that’s more sensitive to real-time changes in the training data is also able to adjust its parameters and goals in an effort to make them more <span class="No-Break">autonomously nimble.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey’s recent <em class="italic">Technology Trends Outlook 2022</em> report highlights next-generation software development as another strategic trend to look out for, citing the increase of low-code/no-code platforms and AI code recommendations based on context from natural language, AI-based testing that automates performance testing and AI-assisted code review as another key trend for the next decade. They see the strategic involvement of AI in the planning and analysis, architecture design, development, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance as a key focus for organizations that are building products or internalizing this trend to experience <span class="No-Break">its benefits.</span></p>
			<p>So far, we’ve had a chance to discuss the highest growth areas, embedded AI, ethical AI, creative AI, and autonomous AI development, coming from some of our most highly reputable research and consulting organizations. In the next section, let’s get into the numbers to get a better sense <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>of the scale of <span class="No-Break">these trends.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor391"/>Trends in AI adoption – let the data speak for itself</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’ll be looking at some of the data that’s come out of Forrester, Gartner, and McKinsey <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>about the growth areas previously outlined: embedded AI, ethical AI, creative AI, and autonomous AI development. Compiling the numbers into a section based on the data that’s come out of the research helps highlight the importance of these growth areas and gives us a bird’s-eye view of the state of AI adoption overall. We’ll begin the section with general trends about AI adoption overall and get into the numbers for each growth <span class="No-Break">area next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor392"/>General trends</h2>
			<p>According to research done by Forrester on trends impacting the US, China, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, <em class="italic">“AI software spend will double from 2021 to 2025, reaching $64 billion.”</em> What’s driving this adoption is the rise in AI-bolstered software products, particularly<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> the rise of software companies expanding their AI features and capabilities, as well as a rise in AI tools made for creating other AI products and applications and, ultimately, the rise in AI native <span class="No-Break">products themselves.</span></p>
			<p>Based on Forrester’s <em class="italic">Global AI Software Forecast, 2022</em>, overall, the AI software industry will <em class="italic">“grow 50% faster than the overall software market,”</em> and by 2025, 31% of AI software spending will be AI-infused. Forrester’s <em class="italic">Data and Analytics</em> survey also shows that <em class="italic">“73% of data and analytics decision-makers are building AI technologies, and 74% see a positive impact on their organizations from the use </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">of AI.”</em></span></p>
			<p>Gartner’s findings are even more aggressive compared to Forrester’s on high-level AI trends citing that worldwide AI software revenue is forecast to total $62.5 billion in 2022 and that <em class="italic">“By 2025, the market for artificial intelligence (AI) software will reach almost $134.8 billion. Over the next five years, the market growth will accelerate from 14.4% in 2021 to reach 31.1% in 2025, considerably outpacing the overall software </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">market growth.”</em></span></p>
			<p>Their top categories of AI adoption for 2022 by use case include knowledge management with a growth rate of 31.5%, virtual assistants with a growth rate of 14.7%, autonomous vehicles with a growth rate of 20.1%, digital workplace with a growth rate of 20%, and crowdsourced data with a growth rate of 19.8%. All growth rates are compared with their 2021 numbers and indicate an upward trajectory of adoption of AI across a wide variety of industries and <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey’s general AI trends also offer a lot of confidence, citing that AI could deliver an economic output of around $13 trillion by 2030 and that global GDP would increase by about 1.2 percent per year but that this economic boom would mostly serve developed countries and companies that adopt AI early. Their retrospective <em class="italic">State of AI in 2022</em> and a <em class="italic">Half Decade in Review Survey</em> offer us a chance to stop and reflect on how the last five years of AI adoption have gone. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 across respondents, and the average number of AI capabilities that organizations use has also doubled. These <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>are encouraging numbers that indicate adoption is moving steadily along with global trends <span class="No-Break">and predictions.</span></p>
			<p>The McKinsey review survey also goes into some of the top use cases of AI deployment, listing that <em class="italic">service operations optimizations</em> (internal applications of AI in organizations) have been the highest functional activity among respondents that have adopted AI, followed closely by the <em class="italic">creation of new AI-based products. </em>Other notable functions included were <em class="italic">new AI-based enhancements of products, product feature optimization,</em> and <em class="italic">predictive service </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and intervention.</em></span></p>
			<p>Another telling statistic from the McKinsey report is that 52% of respondents report more than 5% of their digital budgets are going to AI, up from 40% in 2018, and 63% of them said their investment would grow in the next 3 years, signaling that investment in AI is going to continue. This is in keeping with the signals from Forrester <span class="No-Break">and Gartner.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>Embedded AI – applied and integrated use cases</h2>
			<p>Let’s take a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>what the data shows us with regard to one of the highest growth areas of AI: embedded AI. McKinsey reports that 56% of their survey respondents said their organizations are adopting AI, there’s been a 94.4% improvement in training speed since 2018, there were 30 times more AI patents filed in 2021 than in 2015, and $93.5 billion was invested in AI-related companies in 2021, doubling from 2020. McKinsey also cites industrializing ML, or the adoption and scaling of ML capabilities, as another key trend that will show the greatest return for the <span class="No-Break">next decade.</span></p>
			<p>They also outline industrializing AI into several key areas, including data management, model development, model deployment, live-model operations, and overall ML workflow. Based on their research, the global revenue impact potential of AI across industries is $10-15 trillion, and companies adopting AI are 2.5x more likely to experience higher 5-year returns to their shareholders. These growth projections do come with a massive caveat, however: 72% of the organizations they surveyed for this report have not been able<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> to successfully adopt and scale AI. Among the biggest contributors to this are difficulties transitioning pilot projects into products, models failing in production, difficulties with scaling their AI/ML team’s productivity, and limitations in <span class="No-Break">containing risks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>Ethical AI – responsibility and privacy</h2>
			<p>The numbers for the growth <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>of ethical AI practices are also encouraging and indicate that individuals and companies are taking the ethics and responsibility that AI comes with seriously as their level of experience and investment grow. Forrester predicts 25% of tech executives will need to report their AI governance activities to their boards to cover <em class="italic">“explainability, fairness audits of high-impact algorithmic decision-making, and accounting for environmental impacts of AI (green AI).”</em> This also indicates that boards and high-level decision makers are aware of the risks that come with not properly accounting for potential harm AI can pose to customers, users, <span class="No-Break">and organizations.</span></p>
			<p>Based on their own research in this area, Gartner expects that by 2023, anyone that’s hired for development and training work on AI systems will need to demonstrate they have expertise in ethical and responsible AI. Their outlook on what they consider causal AI, or AI that’s able to demonstrate explainability and deliver on communicating causal relationships, is <span class="No-Break">much longer.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner believes causal AI <em class="italic">“will take 5 to 10 years to reach mainstream adoption but will ultimately have a transformational impact on business.”</em> Here, we also see the relationship between trust and responsibility going hand in hand, with companies understanding that explainability and communicating risk impacts even those that hold high positions <span class="No-Break">within companies.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner lists <strong class="bold">AI trust, risk, and security management</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI TRiSM</strong>) as a strategic technology<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> trend for 2023, citing that <em class="italic">in the U.S, U.K. and Germany 41% of organizations had experienced an AI privacy breach or security incident.</em> This further highlights that the world is still ripe for responsible AI practices that bleed into privacy and security and they are very much needed and will continue to stay relevant. Seeing these indicators in research organizations is encouraging, but it’s just a prediction of the future, not <span class="No-Break">a manifestation.</span></p>
			<p>As companies continue to build and<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> invest in their AI products, they will need to not only build products in a trustworthy way for the benefit of their users but they should come to understand that not doing so can threaten their own investment in the AI tech they’ve spent so much time, money, and <span class="No-Break">patience building.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Creative AI – generative and immersive applications</h2>
			<p>Creative AI apps had a great<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> year in 2022, and Forrester predicts there will be an increase in Fortune 500 companies’ dependence on creative AI and how they will generate content with AI tools because <em class="italic">“human-produced content creation will never be fast enough to address the need for personalized content at scale, and in the next year, we expect to see at least 10% of companies invest in AI-supported digital content creation”</em>. This indicates that organizations will increasingly rely on these apps for their own marketing and content strategy goals, signaling opportunity in the B2B marketing world for AI generative apps. But this number doesn’t include the many consumers that will be interested in creative AI apps for purely <span class="No-Break">recreational purposes.</span></p>
			<p>Gartner’s data follows suit, citing that by 2025, generative AI will account for 10% of all data produced, up from less than 1% today. Gartner’s focus on Generative AI can be used for a range of activities, such as creating software code, facilitating drug development, and targeted marketing, but it can also be misused for scams, fraud, political disinformation, forged identities, and more. This further highlights the increasing dependency businesses will have on using creative AI, not just from a marketing perspective but also from an <span class="No-Break">operational perspective.</span></p>
			<p>The more business use cases are built and optimized for creative AI apps, the more content they will be able to <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>generate, particularly when you consider those needs starting to exist at scale. Those numbers are hard to predict for the consumer market, however, because 2022 was really the first year creative AI saw huge levels of adoption, with individual consumers using them <span class="No-Break">for recreation.</span></p>
			<p>As time goes on, we will start to see more projections that capture the consumer market for creative AI. If the current buzz around creative AI apps in the consumer market is any indication, we will likely see more excitement around new use cases and products, particularly as they integrate with other emerging technologies such as AR/VR, Web3, and <span class="No-Break">metaverse applications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor396"/>Autonomous AI development – TuringBots</h2>
			<p>The data for autonomous<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> AI development is also encouraging and mirrors the data we’re seeing for creative AI apps. Forrester goes as far as to say that TuringBots will write<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> 10% of code worldwide by the end of 2023. Because of the rise in popularity of reinforcement learning and language models<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> such as <strong class="bold">GPT-4</strong> (which powers <strong class="bold">ChatGPT</strong>), we’re seeing that we can take low- and no-code tools a step further and actually produce code with the help of AI using nothing more than basic instructions expressed in any natural human language. This is particularly exciting as we’re still in the midst of a shortage of developers, tech workers, data scientists, and <span class="No-Break">ML engineers.</span></p>
			<p>McKinsey follows suit, citing that 70% of new software development will be built using no- or low-code tech by 2025, which will reduce development time by 90%. This is great news for the build and creation process of software. The deployment time will be twice as fast because of continuous integration and continuous delivery practices, which will be helped by AI. Considering deployment is often the hardest part of making ML and AI use cases successful, and also brings a lot of confidence. 37% of McKinsey’s survey participants said they would use AI/ML to test and maintain their existing code repositories, bringing the advantage of AI-assisted coding to <span class="No-Break">another level.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we’ve delved into the research to get some concrete numbers supporting some of the highest growth areas in AI in this current climate. Hopefully, this section has given you a few ideas to think about when considering bringing AI capabilities into the products you already manage. In the following section, we will talk about AI enablement, an essential component to set up before you get started on your journey to embrace AI and properly set it up <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>Low-hanging fruit – quickest wins for AI enablement</h1>
			<p>By now, you’ve seen how involved applied ML is for an organization to embrace fully, and we’ve just spent most of this chapter looking through the various growth areas in AI for organizations that are already in<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> business and are looking to capitalize on these growth areas. In <em class="italic">Part 1</em> of this book, we discussed the various layers of infrastructure that need to be supported in an AI program. In <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, we discussed the AI native product. In this current section of the book, we’re discussing the transition of incorporating AI into a traditional <span class="No-Break">software product.</span></p>
			<p>This means we can now move on to set the stage for what this adoption looks like, but before we get started, we want to include a caveat. We really can’t talk about AI transformation unless we also set ourselves up for success to be able to begin the long and arduous process that is AI adoption. We have to make sure the conditions are right. Whether you’re working in an organization that’s ready to build an AI native product or you’re in a traditional software environment that’s ready to adopt AI at the feature level, there’s a level of<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> expectation setting that’s required for the endeavor to be successful. But setting expectations properly in an already established software company that isn’t used to the demands AI will place on an organization is <span class="No-Break">especially difficult.</span></p>
			<p>There are both tangible and intangible challenges to building the right conditions for AI. The tangible ones lie with the infrastructure, the investment, and, frankly, the skill. Building out your team and bringing in folks that can troubleshoot and navigate the tricky conditions AI will force you to work in requires a special set of skills, and those skills are sought by virtually everyone right now. Building out established processes and workflows that support the various facets of an AI program is a formidable project that can be challenging to scope, much like AI <span class="No-Break">projects themselves.</span></p>
			<p>The intangible challenges are more cerebral and emotional. In <a href="B18935_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, we discussed the differences between traditional software products and AI-native products. If you recall that section, one of the biggest differences lies in the uncertainty AI brings. When you have an established team that’s already used to a certain level of expectation, it can be difficult to articulate just how much AI is going to change things. The uncertainty that comes with AI makes it very difficult to communicate the full extent of allocating a budget for teams, purchasing software, managing expectations of timelines and costs, and resetting boundaries in terms of how teams work with <span class="No-Break">one another.</span></p>
			<p>You can’t have a fully supported AI program if your internal teams don’t have the right infrastructure and procedures in place. You also can’t have it if you do have the infrastructure and processes, but your internal teams haven’t emotionally internalized them yet. According to Gartner, <em class="italic">“By 2025, the 10% of enterprises that establish AI engineering best practices will generate at least three times more value from their AI efforts than the 90% of enterprises that do not.”</em> There’s a significant upside for companies that do their due diligence to set up their AI <span class="No-Break">programs properly.</span></p>
			<p>The work of bridging the gap between the tangible and intangible challenges of AI is what’s referred to as AI enablement. In order for a traditional software product to transition into an AI product as seamlessly as possible, its leaders and product managers need to create a plan to make this transition successful. Adopting AI is a massive shift for your organization and the way it builds products. It’s a fundamental change to how we expect to build. Building a strong culture of AI enablement means that you’re preparing your teams as best as you can for what’s <span class="No-Break">to come.</span></p>
			<p>At its core, AI enablement is really all about the data. Finding a way to most efficiently collect, label, and curate large amounts of unstructured data is what allows model performance to improve<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> most consistently. Improving that data pipeline, keeping it clean, and making sure there is a steady supply of it to be used for training purposes is what gives the AI/ML pipeline its capabilities. Making sure the right data transformations are happening and the proper level of data quality is in place is the ultimate objective of AI enablement. This is because of the tremendous reliance AI has <span class="No-Break">on data.</span></p>
			<p>The best combination of AI enablement or AI readiness will come from having strong use cases to support your investment in AI, having strong networks of clean data you can leverage to support those use cases, and having a clear governance strategy of who can access what and how roles are delineated within your organization to demonstrate ownership, control, and safety measures to make sure your AI investment is as successful as possible. We will go into these concepts in more depth in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter was all about trends and insights for AI adoption collected from some of the most reputable companies that speak about it. We looked at some of their insights and projections for the coming years and decades regarding AI adoption. Building an AI-native product is, in many ways, more straightforward than transitioning a product from traditional software development to an <span class="No-Break">AI product.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we wanted to set the stage and discuss some of the high-growth areas for AI adoption because, for many companies, knowing where to begin is often the hardest part. Once you’re in the flow of things, you can better anticipate what comes next, but when you’re at the precipice of a major paradigm shift, there’s a lot of friction. Going over the growth areas, data, and common use cases and setting the stage for AI enablement was an intuitive choice to make sure product managers out there are aware of what adopting AI can mean for their product. It’s a big responsibility and undertaking, and it should be treated <span class="No-Break">as such.</span></p>
			<p>In the next and final chapter, we will go into a lot of the applied considerations of transitioning a product to adopt AI and tangibly what that means for your product team <span class="No-Break">or organization.</span></p>
