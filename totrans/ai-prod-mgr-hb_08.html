			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Customization for Verticals, Customers, and Peer Groups</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll understand how products evolve and segment themselves across <strong class="bold">verticals</strong>, <strong class="bold">customers</strong>, and <strong class="bold">customer peer groups</strong>. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how you can start to think of product management’s role in orienting <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) products for specialized groups and, ultimately, what AI allows you to do for those groups. <strong class="bold">AI</strong> and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) are powerful tools but have a general power that needs to be applied specifically in order for their value to be fully understood. In many ways, the work of a <strong class="bold">product manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">PM</strong>) is to make that value as obvious as possible to everyone, from customers <span class="No-Break">to developers.</span></p>
			<p>The role of a PM incorporates a lot; it’s multifaceted by nature. You’re involved with designing the product, organizing the workflow as that product evolves, analyzing feedback from your customers, incorporating that feedback into your overarching business goals, researching new methods and improvements, building the greater product strategy that aligns with your company’s strategy, and, ultimately, communicating across all levels to all your stakeholders, developers, and leaders. This requires a lot of understanding, intimacy, and commitment to your product and <span class="No-Break">its success!</span></p>
			<p>When you incorporate the role of a PM into an AI PM, you’ve got a few more areas to consider. You’ll want to understand the options you have in terms of ML algorithms and data models, as well as understanding how AI will move the needle as far as your acceptance criteria and key metrics are concerned. You’ll also want to have an understanding of data privacy and AI ethics to make sure you aren’t building something that might cause harm to any of your customers or the greater business down <span class="No-Break">the line.</span></p>
			<p>Above all, the role of an AI PM will require a level of data fluency and literacy. Gaining an intuition about how to use data, how to apply data to specific use cases, and understanding a bit about statistics and the data models themselves will be crucial to making sure you’ve got enough of an understanding to be confident as an AI PM. This area is, in many ways, a prerequisite to being able to start your AI PM career. As an AI PM, you’ll be working with data heavily. Critical thinking and complex problem-solving will be necessary to build a successful product that best aligns with the specific use case for your AI product. As the chapter continues, we’ll be exploring the most common use cases, domains, verticals, and peer groups that AI is <span class="No-Break">leveraged in.</span></p>
			<p>The topics we will cover in this chapter are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding domain spaces and how AI can be optimized for <span class="No-Break">these domains</span></li>
				<li>Fluency with various verticals that are seeing a high saturation of <span class="No-Break">AI products</span></li>
				<li>Understanding user <span class="No-Break">behavior analytics</span></li>
				<li>Optimizing value metrics for <span class="No-Break">AI products</span></li>
				<li>Learning from peers in your space through thought leadership <span class="No-Break">and consultancy</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Domains – orienting AI toward specific areas</h1>
			<p>When discussing <strong class="bold">domains</strong>, there <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>are really two major domains you’ll want to invest significant time establishing credibility in. The first is in <em class="italic">understanding AI concepts</em> themselves, which<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> we’ve already covered extensively throughout this book so far. The second is in <em class="italic">understanding how AI is helping certain domains achieve success</em>. Considering that the part of the book we’re in is focused on building an AI-native product, we will focus on how an AI PM can achieve this as they’re setting out to build a new <span class="No-Break">AI product.</span></p>
			<p>Depending on the industry you’re in, you’re going to want to understand your space well enough that you have an understanding of who your direct and indirect competitors are. This might be more straightforward or not, depending on the space you’re working and competing in. Gartner has a great tool called <strong class="bold">the magic quadrant</strong>. The four areas of the quadrant are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leaders</strong>: Established <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>players in a market that have been most reliable and prevalent. They demonstrate the most complete vision as well as the highest ability <span class="No-Break">to execute.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Challengers</strong>: Newcomers that are threatening the dominance of leaders in a given market. Their <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>completeness of vision isn’t quite where it is for leaders, but they are able to compete <span class="No-Break">on execution.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visionaries</strong>: This group has a lot of vision but their ability to execute is limited, so they’re competing<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> with leaders but they’re not able to execute quite as quickly <span class="No-Break">or comprehensively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Niche players</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>group is able to focus on a limited amount of use cases and serve that select group quite well. They’re not expanding their product suite to meet a higher vision, nor are they aggressively trying to execute to gain a higher market share. They’re happy in <span class="No-Break">their niche.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As an AI PM building a novel AI product in your space, you’ll want to have an understanding of all four kinds of competitors in your chosen space or domain. The four quadrants themselves are<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> built on an <em class="italic">x</em> axis based on the completeness of vision, and a <em class="italic">y</em> axis based on the ability to execute. We’re not able to share the visuals of this here in this book but we encourage you to use Gartner’s magic quadrant as a resource when evaluating your organization’s placement in your own market, as well as the placement of your biggest competitors. Your ability to gauge where you fall along these fault lines will best prepare you for coming to market with a new AI product, particularly now that so many AI products are still in their <span class="No-Break">early days.</span></p>
			<p>When building the AI-native product, a lot of initial work needs to go into ideating and positioning your product because it’s so new and it’s entering a new market. In the following sections, we will be focusing on the work of positioning a product appropriately for your market, understanding how your product design will actually serve that market, and how to build an AI product strategy that will make the most sense for <span class="No-Break">your m<a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>arket.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Understanding your market</h2>
			<p>For any specific domain, the leaders are demonstrating a proven history of executing based on the most complete <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>vision. These guys can show you what’s been working and what needs the main market players in the domain are predominately addressing. This will be valuable for you to get a sense of what the addressable market actually wants out of the companies that serve them. Leaders are also great for showing their domains what a sustainable execution of domain pain points looks like, as they’ve been around for a long time and fellow PMs can learn from the products they’ve released and how the greater market has received them over the years. Leaders offer a great foundation for research when you’re in a new domain as <span class="No-Break">a PM.</span></p>
			<p>Though challengers in the quadrant show less of a complete vision, they’re able to address the needs of their market well enough to take some of the market share away from leaders. This is a helpful dynamic to understand when you’re thinking about your own product. If challengers are able to take a market share from the leaders in their domains, it means there are potential fault lines to tap into. Those fault lines are areas where leaders are not <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>addressing the needs of their market adequately and the most successful challengers are able to find opportunities in those <span class="No-Break">fault lines.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, the leaders and challengers may or may not be suiting up their products with AI capabilities, but understanding these two major groups will help you see where there may be potential opportunities as you’re ideating or thinking about building a product to address some common issues or persisting areas of weakness in <span class="No-Break">your domain.</span></p>
			<p>Niche players are not overachieving in the completeness of their vision nor their ability to execute, but it’s exactly what gives them their superpower, as the niche players are able to show you where the edge cases might be. This could help you potentially identify features or use cases for your product as you’re building and designing that have some proven success. These edge cases might be so niche that the challengers and leaders themselves don’t find them strategic to build into their existing product suites, but for an emerging product, this knowledge could be valuable. Getting an understanding of what niches exist within your domain will show you where there might be latent areas of growth that are currently untapped <span class="No-Break">or underserved.</span></p>
			<p>In the final category, we have the visionaries. These are the players that have a robust vision for their product suite and, likely, their entire domain. Visionaries are able to show you what’s possible from a product in your chosen domain and will likely include some of the most cutting-edge features you’re likely to find in your space. As an AI PM, you’ll see most of your direct competitors here because AI features are still slow to adopt in most domains, and we would wager that most of these players are starting to experiment with <span class="No-Break">AI capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re getting started in AI in your domain, and you have the privilege of being involved with your product strategy from the very beginning, understanding the emerging visionaries in your domain will be a great place to start. Today’s visionaries may be tomorrow’s leaders, so you’ll want to get cozy with the names in this category for your <span class="No-Break">chosen domain.</span></p>
			<p>You can do your own market research but either way, you’re going to want to have some sense of the landscape that makes up your domain so that you understand your competition, the problems they’re trying to solve, and the customers that are in your domain as completely<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> as possible. Working with your marketing team or building a comprehensive understanding of your competitive landscape is a crucial layer to building your AI-native product. In order to build something of value, you have to build something that addresses the deepest customer pain points you’re trying to solve <span class="No-Break">with AI.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond the pain points themselves, your product will also begin to collect customer data. This means that you’re not just building a product that addresses your customers’ problems; you’re also improving how your product functions with the data your product is collecting from your customers. We will talk about this specific point further in our UEBA section, but for now, keep in mind that understanding how much and what kind of customer data to collect, in addition to how to use that customer data, will be part of the work you need to do while doing the market research to fully understand the market you’re looking <span class="No-Break">to serve.</span></p>
			<p>Again, this will be a prerequisite for ideating on the early stages of your product design <span class="No-Break">and s<a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>trategy.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Understanding how your product design will serve your market</h2>
			<p>After you feel like you understand the domain, the major players, the way they’re leveraging AI, and some of the<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> main customer pain points you’re looking to solve in your chosen domain, you’re going to be ready to start to ideate on your product. This will come with a whole slew of activities. Before all the wireframing, building version one of your product strategy, and coming up with a roadmap, you’re going to want to be really clear on why you’re using AI to address this market. Building an AI product to address your market without having a clear understanding of why it takes AI to solve this problem is an easy way to waste the money you worked hard <span class="No-Break">to raise.</span></p>
			<p>Yes, there’s a market splash and many start-ups embrace AI for the funding alone, but this alone will not have enough substance to get you through the stages of responsibly building an AI product that will perform well in your market. Before you go out and build an amazing product that solves all your customers’ problems with the power of AI, you will need to solve the fundamental question of <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Why AI?</em></span></p>
			<p>Once you have a clear idea of why you’re using AI to solve your customers’ issues, you have the building blocks of your marketing message. Because we’re at an integral time for AI products, just coming to market with AI features is enough to put you in the position of having to evangelize AI in your domain. Sure, some industries and domains are seeing lots of AI features already, as we will cover in the next section, but by and large, you’ll likely be <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>among the first so this question of <em class="italic">Why AI</em> will keep coming up from your customers, from your competitors who insist their product is superior, or from your design and building <span class="No-Break">team internally.</span></p>
			<p>As you begin to ideate, you will need to keep this answer, along with your customers’ major problems, at the front of your mind so that you’re remaining customer focused and dedicated to your message. As you build through the initial versions of your product, always keep asking how AI is helping you solve your customers’ most frustrating and integral needs. As a PM, you’re an energy-generating force within your company. This means that your work of ideating and building a solution that works for everyone is also meant to stimulate your leadership team. Keeping your focus on <em class="italic">Why AI</em>, as well as the primary problems of the customers you’re serving, means you’re keeping your leadership team focused <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>Keeping your leadership team, <strong class="bold">go-to-market</strong> (<strong class="bold">GTM</strong>) marketing/business development/sales team, and <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>development team aligned toward your customers and the AI solutions you’re bringing to the table means you’re helping your entire stakeholder team focus on your main goal, which is to build an AI product that best addresses your market’s needs. This seems like an obvious point, but as many PMs know, once you get started with the day-to-day work of building and evolving a product through your various sprints, losing sight of your main goal is easier than it seems. There are so many specialized skills that an AI PM needs, so keeping this focus is important when you start getting into the weeds with your design, choose which AI algorithms to go with,<a id="_idTextAnchor253"/> and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Building your AI product strategy</h2>
			<p>Once you’ve done the <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>work on designing a product that addresses your customers’ and the market’s major pain points you want to solve with AI, you’re then in a position to start to build out your overarching product strategy. Obviously, your product MVP will start somewhere but after that, there needs to be a course for your product vision to grow toward. Remember that completeness of vision was one of the <em class="italic">x</em> axes in the Gartner magic quadrant? The reason for this is that an addressable market has a variety of needs ranging in complexity. Your product MVP will only solve a small fraction of these needs. Your leadership and company goals will likely not be to solve all the needs of your market, but you will need to work with your leadership team to define what you’re looking to do for your market at large, as this will directly inform your <span class="No-Break">product strategy.</span></p>
			<p>Remember, building <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>a product strategy falls on the PM but creating company goals falls on leadership, so in many ways, you can consider your leadership team as offering you the crucial outputs (the company goals) you need to build a robust product strategy, vision, and roadmap that aligns with your company’s business objectives. Once you can take these overarching company goals and turn them into a product vision, strategy, and roadmap, you’re able to communicate this to your development team and start the work of building the actual product, which will result in an MVP all the stakeholders involved can be proud of that satisfies the minimum solution needed for your company to go to market with <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>In order to build a product strategy and vision that can grow with your market, you will need to see how your market has been changing and have as complete an understanding as you possibly can to look at where this market is headed. Countless articles come out every day about the trends for particular industries and domains. As an AI PM, it’s even more important for you to keep ahead of these articles so that you have a clear picture of how your market is changing and evolving. Many of your internal stakeholders, along with your customers, will be looking to you for thought leadership and communications about how your company or product suite is growing with the market. Staying aware of these market trends, particularly as they align with your AI strategy, will be necessary for you to keep maturing your product strategy responsibly in a robust, evolving, <span class="No-Break">unpredictable world.</span></p>
			<p>Nowadays, specific domains can have hundreds or thousands of competitors in the space. Particularly now that so many start-ups can erupt and work remotely first, we’re seeing a growing number of companies coming into virtually every domain. Being able to communicate your company’s offering in a way that meets your customers where they are, using the technical language or jargon they’re familiar with, and being able to show them why your product is the best choice through AI will be your challenge and opportunity as an <span class="No-Break">AI PM.</span></p>
			<p>While we will be going over some of the common use cases as we continue with this chapter, we do want to stress one important point before we complete this section: AI is incredibly customizable. Its basic building blocks are data, and what you choose to do with that data is really what gives AI the power it possesses. If you’re an eager, talented PM in the AI space and you’re passionate about solving your customers’ major problems through a novel product <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>you’re helping build, you can build something highly customizable to your customers’ <span class="No-Break">specific needs.</span></p>
			<p>That’s what the next decade will show us as we look toward new ways of applying AI in a way that addresses specific domains perfectly. If a great solution doesn’t yet exist, see whether you can dream it up yourself. If you can pull it off, your domain can reward you with thought leadership bragging rights, an ever-growing customer roster, and the knowledge that you were able to forge something memorable in the wilderness. Many still think of applied AI as the Wild West because many of us technologists know that by 2030, we will be looking back on some amazing breakthroughs and use cases of AI that we haven’t even thought of yet. It’s important to keep this spirit of curiosity and creativity alive in such a <span class="No-Break">nascent field.</span></p>
			<p>For many AI PMs, you likely already have some familiarity and credibility built in your domain. It is possible to grow your reputation in your chosen domain by bringing something novel to your company, organization, or industry. AI offers a vehicle to do this but again, you first must have a clear answer to why you want to be using AI that goes beyond the marketing fluff so that you can stand out from the competition. Making sure that you’re understanding your market needs, understanding how your product will specifically address those needs, and building and communicating a product strategy that aligns all that into one path forward will be a great way to make sure AI is properly oriented toward your <span class="No-Break">chosen domain.</span></p>
			<p>This is agnostic, no matter which domain you’re in. Some domains will be more advanced as far as AI adoption is concerned and this will make your work as an AI PM more and less difficult because each level of advancement of AI has its own slew of challenges and opportunities, but the process will be the same regardless. If you’re in a domain that is more advanced as far as AI adoption is concerned, you’ll be more interested in which AI features your competitors are using to address certain needs and decide whether that’s a direction you want to go in as you refine your product strategy. If you’re in a domain that’s less advanced, you’ll have to look to other industries for inspiration for AI adoption and you’ll be able to make a more eye-catching splash with your own product in <span class="No-Break">your market.</span></p>
			<p>Either way, you will be able to successfully reach a market when you’re able to apply all you’ve learned in a way that offers your domain something that’s currently missing from the offerings that already exist. As an AI PM, you don’t need to be an expert in all areas of AI but you do need to have enough of an understanding of your market and AI capabilities/strategies/algorithms that will best serve the exact use cases you’re trying to apply <span class="No-Break">AI toward.</span></p>
			<p>Once you’re able to<a id="_idIndexMarker367"/> see progress in this area, you’re then looking to make sure your market receives the message that your product has arrived. Whether it’s through your customers, conferences and trade shows, ads, marketing messages, or your own efforts of evangelism, your goal is to make sure your domain sees you because you’re ready to spread the word about the problems in your domain and why your AI product is best suited to <span class="No-Break">solve them!</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve spent some time seeing how to best position a product for your market and the considerations of building an AI strategy that serves the customers you’re trying to attract, we can take a look at some of the most popular verticals for AI. Each vertical will have a series of popular use cases that we see time and again, and this can shed light on some of the greatest benefits AI can give <span class="No-Break">ce<a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>rtain verticals.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Verticals – examination into four areas (FinTech, healthcare, consumer goods, and cybersecurity)</h1>
			<p>We discussed general domains in understanding how AI is to be oriented in your chosen domain in the previous section. In this section, we will be looking at four specific verticals – that is, <strong class="bold">fintech</strong>, <strong class="bold">healthcare</strong>, <strong class="bold">consumer goods</strong>, and <strong class="bold">cybersecurity</strong> – that have seen increased AI adoption in order to best demonstrate trends within major areas of AI development through these examples. Getting an understanding of how and why AI was adopted in these verticals can give us promising examples of how AI can be applied in other domains as well. Let’s explore the adoption of AI in these <a id="_idTextAnchor257"/><span class="No-Break">four verticals.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>FinTech</h2>
			<p>Perhaps the swiftest<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> and most substantial AI transformation has been in the fintech<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> space, and it’s not surprising to see why. AI applied toward specific use cases can bring about significant revenues saved or generated when done right. According to a recent report by UnivDatos Market Insights, “<em class="italic">The AI in Fintech Market is expected to grow at a steady rate of around 30% owing to the increasing demand for fraud detection, virtual helpers coupled with easy transactions, and chatbots for quick and instant </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">query solutions</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a look at some of <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>the most compelling use cases of AI for the fintech space that have contributed to <a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>its <span class="No-Break">quick adoption.</span></p>
			<h3>Chatbots</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Chatbots</strong> or <strong class="bold">conversational AIs</strong> use <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) to handle more of the <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>customer service through what’s referred to as <strong class="bold">sentiment analysis</strong>. NLP is made<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> up of two components – <strong class="bold">natural language generation</strong> and <strong class="bold">natural language understanding</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLG</strong> and <strong class="bold">NLU</strong>, respectively) – and these language models are used to find patterns in <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>what end <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>users are asking for to inform things such as a centralized knowledge base, a frequently asked questions page, or to help the company understand more about their customers and what they’re looking for. Where ML and deep learning work with data points, in NLP, the data points are the words themselves and it’s their orientation and arrangement that <span class="No-Break">gets optimized.</span></p>
			<p>Players in the fintech space are able to use chatbots to also optimize for other things, such as customer feedback with their fintech apps, process automation, and lowering wait times. They’re also great for capturing generational sentiments, such as not wanting to jump on a quick call, something that’s increasingly prioritized by the younger generations that prefer to interact with a brand digitally. For instance, the Bank of America has seen its Erica chatbot reach 1 million users and plans to increase its AI capabilities because of how accessible Erica has been to its users. Outside of fintech, chatbots are often used to assist with call centers and customer servic<a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>e departments <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<h3>Fraud detection</h3>
			<p>This is a big one, particularly because so many financial institutions are left with a risk when there is fraudulent activity on an account. Therefore, it makes sense that one of the primary use<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> cases for AI that caught on heavily within fintech has to do with catching fraud more efficiently. In this use case, AI is being used for anomaly detection within accounts so that banks and other financial institutions can be alerted faster when an activity that’s outside an existing customer’s pattern of behavior is identified. This is also used for money laundering and other <span class="No-Break">illegal activities.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Fraud detection</strong> as a use case isn’t quite as straightforward as building a chatbot because there are likely multiple layers <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>of AI tools working together to make it happen. It’s more likely to be a combination of things. First, some version of continuous data mining is at play to<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> discover whether there are overarching, easy-to-detect patterns in the customer data. There’s also likely to be a rules-based system that’s used to mine as it’s scouring the data and looking for anomalies. On top of this, there are likely unsupervised ML models used to look for patterns beyond the mining and to group activities into clusters to be analyzed later, and there are often neural networks used as well to learn from established suspicious patterns that do turn out to <span class="No-Break">be fraudulent.</span></p>
			<p>Because of the level of sophistication that’s out there now in the cybersecurity space, fraud can come from multiple sources. Fraud can come from the customer themselves, someone impersonating them, an adversarial bot attack, phishing attacks, and other scams. Fintech institutions need to find a way to address all these potential cybercrimes through the help of various layers of AI. Setting up this kind of in-depth operation is expensive, but the cost to run a system like that is nothing in the face of the $51M fintech loses to fraud every year. With regard to fraud detection, there are also temporal qualities to it, so fintech is often looking at finding fraud that has occurred, finding fraud as it’s occurring, and finding and stopping<a id="_idTextAnchor261"/> fraud before <span class="No-Break">it happens.</span></p>
			<h3>Algorithmic trading and predictive analytics</h3>
			<p>AI is helpful when it comes to the fast trading speeds and improving accuracy that’s needed to compete with things such as <strong class="bold">high-frequency trading</strong> (<strong class="bold">HFT</strong>). ML models are used to effectively predict market <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>movements more quickly to help algorithms make their bids, anticipate the best times in the day to make trades, and use historical data for prediction models to understand when the prices might go up. Apart from the main motivator being to make better, more fortuitous trades for their customers, another big driver of the adoption of this AI use case is that algorithmic trading also helps limit mistakes coming from emotional or psychologically stressed traders to limit <span class="No-Break">trade volatility.</span></p>
			<p>Though algorithmic <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>trading relies on a set of instructions to execute decisions, and there are a number of solutions out there that do just that, the underlying technology that supports it is based on predictive analytics. Fintech players are able to crunch so much data and they’re so committed to improving their ML models that even small percentages of improvement in their accuracy or precision could result in millions of dollars of saved revenue or maximized profits. Whether they’re a start-up that’s looking to convert a lead or a bank that’s looking to offer a loan based on a credit score, fintech is<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> using predictive analytics to constantly learn from new and historical data to power most of their decisions so that they know how much a potential customer transaction is w<a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>orth to them in the <span class="No-Break">long run.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Healthcare</h2>
			<p>We’re constantly hearing about the staffing shortages that plague most hospital and health networks, and<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> healthcare is another reasonable vertical that’s embraced the capabilities and help of AI with open arms. Staffing shortages aside, AI has <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>been able to help with one of the most costly impediments to perfection: human error. Because of the increased demand for personnel and the life-and-death urgency that comes with a lot of the medical activities that go on in the name of our well-being and health, AI has been a great contender for fighting some of the most important battles in the healthcare space. We’ve seen AI applied in a range of beneficial ways, from image recognition and <a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>diagnostics to <span class="No-Break">drug discovery.</span></p>
			<h3>Imaging and diagnosis</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Supervised</strong> and <strong class="bold">unsupervised</strong> ML models<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> are used to identify, group, and orient <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>medical images to better understand, for instance, which cells in an image might be cancerous and<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> dangerous. Also, because of the digitizing of medical records, there’s a large amount of data that needs to be analyzed and learned from. Mountains of pieces of data in the form of images from MRIs, CT scans, cardiograms, and ultrasounds are all available to be analyzed en masse. AI is able to help make sense of these images that exist, as well as learn from new graphics and images that are produced as people continue with their medical activities. The more examples it gets, the better it gets at detecting anomalies. As time goes on, we should be seeing improvements in the models optimizing further, to the point where most diagnoses will be coming from <span class="No-Break">AI-assisted doctors.</span></p>
			<p>Because so much data is being analyzed and the use cases for these models are so specialized, the patterns and relationships that the algorithms are looking for are getting refined for accuracy and speed over time. This means that AI apps such as <em class="italic">IBM Watson Health</em> are increasingly getting involved in helping patients diagnostically. This is doubly true when we consider the rise of diagnostic and treatment apps themselves. Cameras are getting really good at picking up even small blemishes and abnormalities that human eyes can’t pick up, so<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> as doctors and patients continue to use apps to assist them on their journey together, and as that data is collected and centralized further and further, we’re likely to see more acc<a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>urate diagnoses over time <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<h3>Drug discovery and research</h3>
			<p>Drug discovery and research have<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> historically been notoriously time- and energy-consuming. A process that might have taken years or decades in the past can be sped up today with the help of AI. We all collectively saw AI applied in this way to address the COVID-19 pandemic and speed up vaccine discovery, and according to the National Library of Medicine, “<em class="italic">AI is being successfully used in the identification of disease clusters, monitoring of cases, prediction of the future outbreaks, mortality risk, diagnosis of COVID-19, disease management by resource allocation, facilitating training, record maintenance and pattern recognition for studying the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">disease trend</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></p>
			<p>Moderna’s chief data and AI officer offers us the best insight into the use of AI in the drug discovery and research phase. As he’s detailing the process for using algorithms across a wide range of opportunities in drug discovery, he’s highlighting that there are countless processes, it’s a very complicated process to bring something to market, and there are just numerous opportunities along the way. Even within a specific use case, you’re rarely using one AI algorithm. It’s often, “<em class="italic">For this part of the problem, we need to use this algorithm, and<a id="_idTextAnchor266"/> for this, we need to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">use another.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Cybersecurity</h2>
			<p>Cybercrime is up, and<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> cybersecurity continues to be one of the most prevalent<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> sources of AI/ML adoption that we see most regularly because of the persistence and sophistication of cyber criminals. The nature of cybersecurity is ever-changing, which means that, over time, companies need to keep step with their potential adversaries. It feels like we hear about a new data leak every day, and perhaps the most alarming part of cybersecurity is the number of attacks you <em class="italic">don’t</em> <span class="No-Break">hear about.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss two popular use cases used in cybersecurity: anomaly detection and <strong class="bold">user<a id="_idTextAnchor268"/> and entity behavior </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">analytics</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">UEBA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Anomaly detection and user and entity behavior analytics</h1>
			<p>Uncovering patterns and changes in those patterns is at the very heart of anomaly detection. In cybersecurity, this established baseline and deviation from it are what create the use case of <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>anomaly detection. Once there’s been an anomaly and an action is required from the system, we can then move toward rectifying it somehow. Often, cyber attacks come from within networks and have clever ways of hiding their tracks, but <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>with advanced pattern recognition that’s used for anomaly detection, AI systems can see when some actor/user is behaving in ways that don’t make sense for a <span class="No-Break">normal user.</span></p>
			<p>As we went through some of the use cases for various verticals, you’re likely seeing patterns of your own emerge in terms of some of the underlying tech used to power those applications of AI. One of these overarching use cases is encapsulated in UEBA, which is, in many ways, an undercurrent for many of the use cases we discussed. As an AI PM, it will be really helpful if you can understand the power of UEBA and how to apply it within your product and beyond, particularly as you’re in the operational phase of building out increasingly powerful features <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>You can think of UEBA as a network of insights that are gathered by basically pooling all your users’ actions and subsequent data that is generated from those actions on a daily basis. Once all this data is centralized and analyzed, it’s able to offer you profound insights by giving you a baseline for not just individual users but for all your users all at once as well. This makes things such as finding anomalies or new patterns, no matter what the change is, easier because you can establish triggers or actions that alert your user or your internal workforce when something that requires attention <span class="No-Break">has happened.</span></p>
			<p>Companies these days need to stay more vigilant than ever, and many don’t have the headcount or allocated budget to truly stay on top of this potential risk, which is why the breaches keep coming. This is a big part of the reason cybersecurity has adopted AI so readily: it’s ripe for it. When use cases are notoriously underfunded and understaffed, AI has an op<a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>portunity to get adopted and <span class="No-Break">truly shine.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Value metrics – evaluating performance across verticals and peer groups</h1>
			<p>No matter what <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>domain, vertical, or peer group your AI product is in, you’re going to need to establish some way of communicating the success of your product through a combination of value (business) metrics, <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>), and <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>), along with a number of technical metrics that might be required when you’re communicating about the efficacy and success of your product to a technical audience. As with anything, if we can’t establish a baseline and see how we’ve grown from that baseline, we won’t know whether our performance is improving (and if it is, by how much) unless we <span class="No-Break">track it.</span></p>
			<p>In the following section, we will be looking at the various types of metrics we will start to collect on our products’ efficacy. For AI products, deciding on which metrics you will track, how you will talk about them, and what kinds of audiences you’ll tailor certain metrics for will be an important part of your pro<a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>duct strategy, as well as <span class="No-Break">your marketing.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Objectives and key results</h2>
			<p>When you’re defining<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> success for your AI product, you’ll want to set some OKRs from a technical and business level so you can track how your AI product is building toward the performance you want to see. OKRs<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> are used heavily in product management to track progress toward higher-level business goals. You’ll want to choose two or three objectives to start with, and you’ll want a group of three to five key results for <span class="No-Break">each objective.</span></p>
			<p>The purpose of this is to show which direct results are impacting the greater overarching business goals your product might be tasked with. Let’s say you’re supporting an AI cybersecurity product. An example of this might be that you want to reduce the number of false negatives for your fraud detection algorithm with a number of key results from the work your product has been able to achieve toward <span class="No-Break">that goal.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll want to set these quarterly and reference them often because these will be the highest focus of your product as you build through each release. The establishment of new OKRs will arise in your product planning sessions and will be informed by the features you have planned in your roadmap, your customers, and customer success and marketing feedback, as well as the ever-evolving goals from leadership in order to best align your product’s objectives with the feedback loops you have in place to make sure you’re building something <a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>that’s valuable to your domain <span class="No-Break">and market.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Key performance indicators</h2>
			<p>KPIs are used more generally and also tend to grow over time as new indicators are discovered as important. Some of the most common KPIs have to do with measuring customer or employee<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> satisfaction, measuring time or accuracy, calculating the cost efficiency or return on investment for purchasing something, or agreeing on a metric that aligns with the company’s goals somehow. There are also categories of KPIs ranging from strategic to operational to functional, which means they’re either affecting the entire company as a whole or are high-level metrics, relating to a specific time frame operationally across the entire company, or relating to <span class="No-Break">specific departments.</span></p>
			<p>If you’ve been working in the<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> business world for some time, you’ve likely heard of KPIs or value metrics in a number of contexts, but in this section, we’re going to specifically cover some common KPIs that are likely to help you when you’re deciding on how to best track and communicate your AI <span class="No-Break">product’s success.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you’re running an AI program agnostically in your business or running an AI program as part of your AI product feature stack, the following KPIs will help with maintaining the health and progress of your AI infrastructure. Being aware of the following metrics will help <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>communicate the success of your AI activities, which is a common part of <strong class="bold">AI </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">operations</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">AIOps</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to detect</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTD</strong>): This is calculating the average time it takes for your product to identify a potential issue. You’ll want to demonstrate that<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> this is minimizing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to acknowledge</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTA</strong>): This is calculating the average time to acknowledge the problem<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> and identify who will resolve it. You’ll want to demonstrate that this is minimizing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time to resolve/repair</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>): This is calculating the average time it takes to actually<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> address the problem. You’ll want to demonstrate that this is minimizing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean time between failures</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTBF</strong>): This is calculating the average time between failures to give a<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> sense of how long the AI program is working optimally. You’ll want to demonstrate that this is growing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ticket to incident ratio</strong>: Recognition that one incident may create multiple tickets so this metric seeks<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> to minimize the number of tickets or logs that are created by customers when one issue is being experienced. You’ll want to demonstrate that this is minimizing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service availability</strong>: The uptime where your AI program is running optimally without issues. You’ll want to<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> demonstrate that this is growing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated versus manual resolution</strong>: This is essentially labeling which response was manual or automated so that your ML program can optimize for strategies in the future <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>and learn from past remediations. You’ll want to demonstrate that this is growing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User reporting versus automatic detection</strong>: This is the ratio between how many customers reported <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>an issue versus how often your own product detected the issue. You’ll <a id="_idTextAnchor276"/><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>w<a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>ant to demonstrate that this is minimizing <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Technical metrics</h3>
			<p>The following list includes some of the common technical KPIs that are used to communicate the accuracy of <span class="No-Break">ML models:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Classification accuracy</strong> (<strong class="bold">precision or specificity, recall or sensitivity, and F1 score</strong>): There are<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> a number of formulas that try to derive how often your models are correct, whether by the rate of true and false positives, the rate of true and false negatives, or some combination of the two (an <span class="No-Break">F1 score)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Root mean square error</strong> (<strong class="bold">RMSE</strong>): The root of<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> the average rate of error for <span class="No-Break">regression models</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mean absolute error</strong> (<strong class="bold">MAE</strong>): The average<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> rate <span class="No-Break">of error</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are a number of other metrics you might want to keep track of. Perhaps you will have categories of all your metrics that pertain to the volume or amount of data sources or availability, perhaps you’ll want to quantify or qualify the strength or robustness of your AI/ML organization somehow, or have metrics related to your product marketing outputs or the availability of models. Perhaps you’ll have adoption metrics beyond just your users to understand how certain teams are using your products internally. Defining business goals is a highly selective and customized activity that should, first and foremost, serve the highest ideals of<a id="_idTextAnchor279"/> your business: to best serve your customers <span class="No-Break">and market.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Thought leadership – learning from peer groups</h1>
			<p>At the start of this chapter, we discussed the idea of building a foundation in your domain and understanding (as much as possible) what the specific pain points in your domain are with the aim of building an AI product that will serve the space for years to come. Building a product that works well, aligns with what your customers need, and employs modern technology is a fast way to build the credibility that’s necessary to spread thought leadership across <span class="No-Break">your domain.</span></p>
			<p>You might choose to take on a leadership role in your domain in order to be positioned as a leader in your industry. With all the <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>knowledge hubs and white papers and product one-pagers that are out there, it’s common to see companies adopt the role of an industry thought leader for a number of reasons. Maybe this is for marketing, inbound leads, glory, or simply because they’re generous with their knowledge <span class="No-Break">and success.</span></p>
			<p>Choosing how open and transparent you want to be with your company’s choices and major roadblocks will be up to you and your leadership team. Will you choose to be an example for the other players in your field? Or will you choose to keep quiet and hold your algorithmic secret sauces, dirty laundry, and success stories close to your chest? Companies are constantly learning from each other, and being a true thought leader in an industry may come at a financial and design cost if you’re not careful of how much information you do let out. As with all risky endeavors of the heart, sometimes we need to open ourselves up to risk in order to also accept the gifts that come <span class="No-Break">with transparency.</span></p>
			<p>As we’ve mentioned so many times, this period of applied AI products is still new. We have yet to understand the future use cases that will allow companies the greatest growth and success. The spirit of innovation and technological advancement is fed through example. Every use case and applied example has the ability to inspire us to discover a new use case. The newness of AI brings with it a kind of excitement about <span class="No-Break">what’s possible.</span></p>
			<p>Particularly in a time when so many are apprehensive about whether AI can and should solve all our biggest problems, maybe it’s up to companies, PMs, technologists, and entrepreneurs to embody the <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>collaborative quality of this spirit. AI products bring together science, data, technology, and humanity in a way that has shown so much promise already. Should you choose to open up and share the examples that do come up in your experience, whether directly or indirectly, the gifts that come along with that won’t just <a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>benefit you or your organization. They will benefit <span class="No-Break">us all.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter was geared toward markets, positioning, and common use cases of AI/ML products. We’ve been able to look at how AI can be optimized for certain domains and markets and how AI can commonly be leveraged in various verticals that are seeing a high saturation of AI products. Through those use cases, we’ve been able to see how companies leverage AI to be able to make the most of the data they have. As an AI/ML PM, you won’t be building your AI-native product in a vacuum. You’ll regularly be studying your market and your competition to make sure you’re bringing use cases for AI that truly set <span class="No-Break">you apart.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B18935_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor284"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, we will be building on use cases of AI products by getting deeper into the landscape of AI technologies, both at a high level and at the feature level. We’ll get a chance to see how various types of AI can be built collaboratively, and we’ll see examples of products that have done this successfully. We’ll also get into some of the common challenges that have impacted the success of products and some of the common factors when things <span class="No-Break">go wrong.</span></p>
