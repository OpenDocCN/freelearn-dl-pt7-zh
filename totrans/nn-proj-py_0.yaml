- en: Machine learning and **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) have become ubiquitous
    in our everyday lives. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we are constantly interacting
    with AI in one way or another. And neural networks and deep learning are driving
    these AI advances. Powered by neural networks, AI systems are now able to achieve
    human-like performance in many areas.

- en: This book provides you with the opportunity to create six different neural network
    projects from scratch. Through these projects, you will have the opportunity to
    create some of the AI systems that we commonly see today, including face recognition,
    sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis. In each project, we'll provide a problem
    statement, the specific neural network architecture to be used to tackle that
    problem, the reasoning for the choice of neural network used, and the Python code
    to implement the given solution from scratch.

- en: By the end of the book, you will be well versed in the different neural network
    architectures, having created cutting edge AI projects in Python that will immediately
    strengthen your machine learning portfolio.

- en: '[Chapter 1](1068b86b-d786-48ba-b91c-35d0ff569460.xhtml), *Machine Learning
    and Neural Networks 101*, covers the basics of machine learning and neural networks.
    The first chapter aims to solidify your understanding of machine learning and
    neural networks. To do that, we''ll create our own neural network from scratch
    in Python, without any machine learning libraries.'

    with Multilayer Perceptrons*, kick-starts our first neural network project. Using
    a basic neural network known as a multilayer perceptron, we''ll build a classifier
    that can predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes.'

    a regression problem. In particular, we''ll use a neural network to predict taxi
    fares in New York City.'

    for an image classification problem. We''ll use the CNN to predict whether an
    image includes a cat or a dog.'

    The images come from office documents corrupted by coffee stains and other artifacts.
    We''ll use autoencoders to remove these artifacts from the images, restoring them
    to their original state.'

    network to analyze and classify the sentiment of movie reviews posted online.
    We''ll create an LSTM neural network that is able to discern the sentiment of
    written English sentences.'

- en: You should have some basic familiarity with programming in Python in order to
    get the most out of this book. Nevertheless, the book will take you through every
    step in the project and explain the code as much as possible.
  prefs: []

- en: In terms of hardware, you should be running the code on a fairly modern computer
    with at least 8 GB of RAM and 15 GB of hard disk space (for the datasets). Training
    deep neural networks requires strong computational resources, and can be sped
    up significantly if you have a dedicated GPU. However, it is perfectly fine to
    run the code without a GPU, as well (such as on a laptop). Throughout the book,
    we will alert you if certain code will take some time to run if you do not have
    a GPU.

- en: At the start of each chapter, we will inform you of the necessary Python libraries
    required for the project. To simplify the set-up process, we have provided an `environment.yml`
    file together with the code. The `environment.yml` file allows you to easily set
    up a virtual environment with the specific Python version and the requisite libraries
    installed in it. This way, you can be assured that your code will be running in
    a standardized virtual environment that we have designed. Detailed instructions
    will be provided in [Chapter 1](1068b86b-d786-48ba-b91c-35d0ff569460.xhtml),  *Machine
    Learning and Neural Networks 101*, under the *Setting up your computer for machine
    learning *section, as well as at the start of each chapter.
