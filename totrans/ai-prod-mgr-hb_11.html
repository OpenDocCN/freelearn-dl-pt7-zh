			<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>The Rising Tide of AI</h1>
			<p>With this chapter, we begin the third major part of this book, which will focus on evolving existing <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>products that don’t currently use <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) to leverage <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>). We will refer to these products as <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>non-ML native products. In the previous part, we discussed ML native products and explored how to go about building an AI native product and how the process unfolds in a way that’s optimal from a data, company, and strategy perspective. Using this same lens, we will now compare and contrast how this process unfolds for products that don’t currently <span class="No-Break">leverage AI.</span></p>
			<p>More specifically, this chapter will re-introduce us to the concept of the fourth industrial revolution. It will serve as a reminder and a blueprint for those of us working as entrepreneurs or product managers for products and organizations that are ready to fully embrace AI. We will be reinforcing the importance of the coming shift towards AI and what it means across industries. For those that are already at a place where they can embrace AI, we hope to offer a plan they can be confident in as they move forward toward evangelizing AI in their products and wider organizations. For those that are still skeptical, we hope it galvanizes you and offers a clear vision of what’s to come so that you can start the work needed to prepare for such a shift. For those that are anti-AI, we hope to offer a glimpse into what a future without AI adoption looks like for your <span class="No-Break">company’s success.</span></p>
			<p>As we continue in this chapter, the first section will go into what the AI evolution will mean to businesses and products in order to best communicate the competitive advantage of embracing AI at the industry level. We will then go over accessible options for adopting AI for companies looking to capitalize on the AI adoption wave in the second section. The final section will focus on the mindset and attitude for AI adoption at the product manager level, as well as how product managers can communicate AI adoption across their organizations. We're honored to be a part of this journey with you, and we hope the coming words offer you solace in a landscape of misinformation and disinformation when it comes to AI and <span class="No-Break">its adoption.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Evolve or die – when change is the <span class="No-Break">only constant</span></li>
				<li>The fourth industrial revolution – hospitals used to <span class="No-Break">use candles</span></li>
				<li>Fear is not the answer – there is more to gain than lose (<span class="No-Break">or spend<a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Evolve or die – when change is the only constant</h1>
			<p>We like referring to the evolution AI will require of all industries as a <em class="italic">competitive imperative</em> because the language we use to describe this paradigm shift will need to be more urgent if it’s going to adequately prepare people for what’s to come. Each industry is a universe <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>in and of itself, and once companies within industries start to see success with AI adoption, this adoption will accelerate. We've mentioned before that product management is an inherently commercial role because, as a product manager or leader, you are tasked with the commercial success of your product. The competitive edge and marketing splash that can come from promoting an AI product <span class="No-Break">is undeniable.</span></p>
			<p>But beyond marketing, AI allows all industries to advance in more tangible ways. All economic and social areas will change with AI, from healthcare to tech, to education and government. The way industries relate to raw materials, plan, predict, and build products will change with this transition to AI adoption. The <strong class="bold">World Economic Forum</strong> (<strong class="bold">WEF</strong>) defines the <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>industrial revolution we’re currently in as <em class="italic">“characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.”</em>  We love this description because it places AI and ML firmly in the middle of these spheres. In order to account for the physical, we need a way to translate the physical world into data. This data could be about anything in the world beyond us, or it could be about our own bodies. The collection and processing of this data will inevitably interact with AI and ML to some degree in order to be actionable in some way, and once this ball gets rolling, we humans, in our infinite creativity and inspiration, will come up with new combinations and expressions beyond the use cases we <span class="No-Break">see today.</span></p>
			<p>The way our lives are changing in seen and unseen ways affects many technological areas, not just AI. We’re currently seeing massive breakthroughs in these areas, and the WEF goes on to say, <em class="italic">“the possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.”</em> This is at the heart of what makes this such a privilege to witness in our time. There’s effectively a technological renaissance happening, and we’re slowly witnessing this renaissance unfold in real time every time we read the news, download a white paper, or find a study. I'm constantly reminding myself how exciting the current technological advancements are when you consider that 10 years ago, I didn’t have <span class="No-Break">an iPhone.</span></p>
			<p>Even beyond <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>the areas where we’re experiencing breakthroughs, casualties, or negative externalities, such as job losses, accompany all this progress. The automation of work will replace tasks and jobs that are routine, and almost all jobs have some routine to them. This is inevitable. It’s also why some fear the age of AI because they’re worried AI will replace their jobs. After all, if a company can get done what it needs to be done by automation, by buying a product, or by using some form of AI to replace a human worker, then why wouldn’t it? There are people who work in operations, procurement, or finance whose entire job is to look for ways to save their companies money, and even those people could find their own jobs automated! Eventually, the shift will come, and in the meantime, we’ll be reading about it one headline at <span class="No-Break">a time.</span></p>
			<p>But what’s more likely is that AI will be used to assist just about all workers with their jobs in some capacity. We don’t mean to minimize the collective loss that will arise with AI. There are jobs in data entry and manufacturing that will never come back, and you could argue they shouldn’t. After all, who likes data entry? Who likes being underpaid at minimum wage, <em class="italic">no- skill</em> jobs? Even the phrase "no-skill" or "low-skill" jobs is degrading, unfair, and often a way for companies to defend their unlivable wages. The fact that the US is still debating over a reasonable minimum wage after years of studies showing a lag in real wage growth is laughable. And yet, AI could make all these debates a moot point by automating the very jobs we’re looking to boost with a higher minimum wage. We've heard arguments that AI will replace jobs that are unenjoyable, mind-numbing, and oppressive. We've also heard arguments that AI will allow humans to capitalize on their curiosity and make even more money working jobs that place a premium on their creative, complex problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This assumes most people want that and don’t want an easy job they can do day in and day out and live a peaceful life free of <span class="No-Break">complex thoughts.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond all the doom and gloom, there’s an upside. Many of the jobs people will be doing in the <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>future are not yet known. According to a report by Dell and the <strong class="bold">Institute for the Future</strong> (<strong class="bold">IFTF</strong>), 85% of jobs that will exist by 2030 don’t exist yet. That’s incredible. What’s perhaps most incredible is that this is all being discovered by all of us as time goes on. Just 15 years ago, we’d be confused if someone told us they were a social media manager. Even throughout my own career, I have seen what was previously called an account manager role shift and morph into a more sales-focused account executive role or more performance-focused role such as customer success manager. The terms data analyst and data scientist also entered the zeitgeist not long ago. The function of both these roles has existed for some time, but the formalization of those roles and what they mean at a certain point in time is a new development. In the near future, we might be hearing about tele-surgeons, data brokers, drone managers, and VR technicians more often than we <span class="No-Break">do now.</span></p>
			<p>The evolution <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>that AI adoption will require of us will have positive and negative effects, as with any technological adoption. Can we say we’re all the better for it now that we have electricity running through the walls of our schools, offices, hospitals, and homes? How can we quantify the social and economic net benefit of such a massive change to how we live and work? How could the contributors of electricity have known that, eventually, their breakthroughs would power the internet and AI? If you could time travel back and tell them, they wouldn’t even understand the gravity of what you were explaining to them in the first place. It’s important to keep an eye on the risks. After all, AI will likely create a greater polarity between jobs and widen the gap between earners. Those that are in the know and can anticipate the way their jobs will change because of AI can better prepare for it, and they’ll probably make more money because they’re embracing this change. Others may find their jobs being automated out of existence. This is all <span class="No-Break">but guaranteed.</span></p>
			<p>We'd love to see governments and companies working together to embrace this technological shift together and to see major sectors of industry recognize a need for skilled workers that can help them build the next generation of their products and to nurture this wave of workers with paid internships, training programs, and leadership programs that will bring more workers into fulfilling careers with a future. I do a lot of speaking engagements addressing upskilling and career transitioning, and I repeatedly remind my audience that their interest, dedication, and commitment to upskilling is immensely helpful to society at large. Data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers are highly sought after, and there’s a huge skill gap. There are not enough skilled, trained, and experienced workers in these fields for the demand that’s coming from companies. If you take on this learning journey, you will eventually find success, and you’ll be rewarded with a lifelong career that will keep your interest. We only hope that our larger institutions will see the upside in helping individuals with the burden of upskilling and invest in making that a smoother <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>transition because it truly is a social and economic investment that’s in everyone’s best interest to <span class="No-Break">be spon<a id="_idTextAnchor367"/>sored.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>The fourth industrial revolution – hospitals used to  use candles</h1>
			<p>It’s hard to overstate the gravity of what AI adoption will mean for all industries and all job roles, and the delineation between <em class="italic">technical</em> and <em class="italic">non-technical</em> roles will start to change as well. Right now, AI is mentioned in business articles for the most part as a rising <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>trend or wave, but this wave is quickly turning into a tsunami. In order to stay competitive with their peers, all companies across all industries will find themselves scrambling toward the digital transformation of AI. As more and more companies do this and successfully advance towards accomplishing AI adoption, we will also be seeing more demand for data-centric roles simply because most products, internal operations, and client discussions will evolve along with the AI adoption strategies <span class="No-Break">of companies.</span></p>
			<p>We’re also already <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>starting to see <strong class="bold">automated ML</strong> (<strong class="bold">autoML</strong>) companies and offerings starting to grow as well. Companies creating autoML products such as DataRobot and H20.ai are starting to pop up more and more. This will allow anyone, even those that don’t actively work as data scientists and ML engineers, to be able to use, tune, test, and deploy ML models for performance. This means that over time, AI adoption will become more accessible to those who choose to take the red pill. This also begs the question: What will happen to data scientists and <span class="No-Break">ML engineers?</span></p>
			<p>Demand for these roles isn’t projected to go down over time. With more and more companies embracing and planning their AI strategies, even companies starting early will find themselves looking for the right resources to get them going. Your business strategy will impact how you wet your feet with machine learning and advanced analytics. Ultimately, your forecasting, market strategy, and growth strategy will influence how quickly and in what manner you’ll approach the creation, continuation, and growth of your AI programs internally. You might decide to start with your product, but you could also start with other internal applications of AI, such as using AI within HR or finance functions. Generally speaking, the best use cases for AI include recommendation, ranking, anomaly detection, classification, prediction or regression, and clustering <span class="No-Break">or grouping.</span></p>
			<p>All of these use cases can be applied to your product or your internal processes. Perhaps you want to predict how much demand there will be for some products you sell for inventory purposes. Perhaps you want to see whether some of your customers’ purchases are fraudulent. Perhaps you’re trying to group your customers into targeted categories. All these problems can be helped with AI. Similarly, you could choose to use certain algorithms in your product development to help your product make predictions for your customers, show them how they are performing compared to their peers, or offer them insight into anomalies within their performance. AI is applicable to both internal and <span class="No-Break">customer-facing expressions.</span></p>
			<p>The number <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>of AI start-ups, the amount of annual investment from venture capitalist firms, job opening projections, and the annual number of published AI papers all have exponential curves. This means we are experiencing a massive explosion in demand and investment in AI, and this is still very much <span class="No-Break">the beginning.</span></p>
			<p>As a company and leadership begin the process of opening up to the capabilities and promise of AI, it’s important to understand the full spectrum of opportunities AI can potentially offer. It’s important for your company and leadership team to fully understand the scope and competitive advantage AI adoption will mean for your business. Product functionality is not the only area AI helps with. Because AI is so data-hungry and progress is derived from performance benchmarking, you first and foremost have to have a healthy data-driven culture throughout the organization. You can’t really see how AI will help you if you don’t have a consistent baseline. Having metrics and KPIs in place to track your performance before you implement AI projects and AI features in your product is crucial for measuring and communicating success. Building this culture must come from the top down and we invite all leaders reading this to invest in building that culture to best see successes from <span class="No-Break">AI adoption.</span></p>
			<p>The second cultural influence we want to stress in this section is to have a willing, open, and curious culture around AI. According to VentureBeat (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/">https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/</a>), 87% of AI projects fail. A big part of this is based on an organization that’s not appropriately set up for success regarding AI adoption. Inundating your data science, ML, and product teams with pressure and stress is not the way to set them up for success. The ability to iterate, experiment, and take some risks with regard to AI so that your teams feel safe to try various use cases is crucial to giving AI the best chance it has within your organization. It’s important to maintain a healthy skepticism and temper expectations with your AI activities until you experience early successes. It’s even more important that you celebrate your early AI successes loudly and proudly across your organization when they <span class="No-Break">do arise.</span></p>
			<p>Your strategy <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>will also define how you approach AI program development. In the following section, we will discuss the major areas of investment with regard to AI strategy so you can choose the best course of action for your business. My best practice would be to use these cumulatively. If you start with a consultant and escalate from there, you’ll be setting your business up for success with regard to AI adoption <span class="No-Break">an<a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>d strategy.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Working with a consultant</h2>
			<p>If you’re just wetting your feet with AI, one area to start with would be to solicit the help of a consultant. Apart from doing your own research within the space, it can be daunting to <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>understand the layout of options you have before you. You’ll also have to make some decisions about what kind of infrastructure you want to have, what the reporting structure will look like for your high-tech projects, and where the easiest applications of data or AI projects would be for maximum visibility within your organization. We always recommend companies start small with a high-impact project because your first attempt at AI will likely be met with hesitation <span class="No-Break">or resistance.</span></p>
			<p>It’s something unknown, and there isn’t an established baseline yet for what success looks like. Consultants are great with a first-time project or just getting you set up with the right infrastructure and workflow to make it happen. Many companies will attempt to take on building an AI pipeline on their own without the help of outside consultants and strategists, but if you don’t have a good baseline of understanding for how to manage an AI program, you could wind up spending a lot of money on decisions that haven’t been properly <span class="No-Break">thought through.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>Working with a third party</h2>
			<p>Perhaps you <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>want to go with a consulting firm to help you instead of one individual person. This would be similar to the previous section but you’d have the added help of a consulting team or a firm that’s done similar work in the past and has worked with a number of companies and has a good reputation. Third parties also tend to verticalize, so you could search within an ecosystem of consulting firms that specialize in your specific industry or use case. Understanding your own goals in relation to your industry peers is a way to make sure you’re going in the right direction from a competitive perspective. Working with a group of consultants also allows you to learn from a group of people that will then work with and educate your <span class="No-Break">own employees.</span></p>
			<p>Many companies also struggle to find the right pool of candidates that actually have the experience they need. AI is a wide field, and depending on the specialization of your product, it might be hard to have enough support internally with the talent you already have. Consultancies have their own network of AI talent, so building a partnership <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>with a firm you trust means you can have a third party that can guide you as your AI/ML needs change over time. It’s a way to hedge against making infrastructure or business investments that turn out to be the wrong choice later on. It’s also a way to make sure you have access to a talent pool that actually suits <span class="No-Break">your needs.</span></p>
			<p>One word of caution for using third parties is that it’s most recommended for high-level organizational education or really select proofs of concept. If you use a consultant for your product or some internal function and you think they’re going to create an awesome ML product for you and let your engineers take it from there, you’re going to be disappointed and your ML project will likely fail to get corporate or leadership sponsorship because the results will be abysmal. Perhaps you’re not ready to have someone on <span class="No-Break">staff yet.</span></p>
			<p>Perhaps you have great developers that can tune and retrain and deploy models regularly but aren’t up to the task of establishing an algorithm or choosing a model and you need someone with more of a statistical background to create the best model for your use case. You might be tempted to just use a consultancy to get you to level one. Avoid this temptation. If you’re actively looking to start with data strategy and AI, use a consultant to educate yourself and arrive at a decision on how to move forward, and then invest in having someone that actually knows your business from the inside out take i<a id="_idTextAnchor372"/>t <span class="No-Break">from there.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>The first hire</h2>
			<p>This brings us to the first hire. I myself was the first data scientist at a company, and it’s not for <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>everybody. Your first hire will be someone that’s enough of a generalist to lay out all the options for you much like a consultant would, but they’re working for you full time so they can run with the ideas if their leadership team agrees with the recommendations. As you’re vetting and interviewing this person, make it clear to them in which area of the business you’re looking to include AI, automation, advanced analytics, or ML. I would also make it clear what the goals are for that position and what you honestly need help with, and what stage you’re at. If you’re in a position to only hire one person to get you started, I would also make sure you have agreement on what a first project looks like so that no one’s surprised on the <span class="No-Break">other end.</span></p>
			<p>You should have a pretty clear idea of your data and AI strategy so that you’re not overloading this person with unrealistic pressure. AI product managers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, data engineers, and data analysts all specialize in their own ways and it’s essentially impossible to find a <em class="italic">data</em> <em class="italic">generalist</em>. Someone that can tell <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>you the best infrastructure for your data and workflows, actually build those pipelines, clean all that data, load it into models, train those models appropriately, deploy those models, and finally communicate the success of all that work in a way that’s meaningful to the business is impossible to find. You also don’t want to just hire a whole team right out the gate without having ways to meaningfully apply their work. These roles don’t come cheap, so investing in a team before you really know how you’re going to use them is like buying a submarine before you get your license to drive a car. AI is a massive investment in your business, so make sure you educate yourself and take advantage of consultants before you start hiring so that you’re not wasting your money. This is an ecosystem, and there’s a place for everyone in it, wi<a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>th <span class="No-Break">good reason.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor375"/>The first AI team</h2>
			<p>Now let’s say you do have a good idea of where to start, some good early projects for your data and AI folks to work on, and you’re already seeing some success in your AI applications. Excitement is buzzing within your business, and you’ve got a number of <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>departments reaching out to you about starting their own ML projects and, suddenly, your lone data scientist or ML engineer is overloaded with work. You start to invest in a team and essentially an entirely new department. In the previous section, we mentioned AI product managers, ML engineers, data scientists, data engineers, and data analysts – this is your AI team. This is the team that will allow you to responsibly build out your AI function and optimize your infrastructure, data management, workflows, data pipelines, modeling, training, deploying, and communicating with the business. Having a dedicated team for this is optimal and ethical because a lot of work and maintenance goes into AI management. If you can afford it, you know how to best make use of your employees, and you know how to keep them happy and dedicated, they will create a wealth of opportunity and success for your prod<a id="_idTextAnchor376"/>uct <span class="No-Break">and business.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor377"/>No-code tools</h2>
			<p>The final section we’ll cover here is the use of low- or no-code tools such as the ones DataRobot <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>and H2O.ai offer. Right now, most of the people that are using these tools are data scientists, so it’s not exactly the kind of tool anyone can use and magically give you AI in return. There’s a basic level of understanding and domain knowledge that the user has to have to understand and deliver value with these tools. Right now, it seems the greatest advantage is that it can streamline the workload of a data scientist or ML engineer if they’re overloaded with projects but it’s by no means a substitute. Deciding on which tools you want to use in your AI team should be part of your infrastructure disc<a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>ussions <span class="No-Break">early on.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>Fear is not the answer – there is more to gain than lose  (or spend)</h1>
			<p>Believing in and dreaming of success are vital skills for a product manager. So much of the role surrounds concepts such as building a product vision, mission, and strategy and ultimately using <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>these tools to create a roadmap that will manifest these more nebulous concepts. As a product manager, you have to train yourself to visualize. You can’t visualize if you don’t maintain clarity and focus on your goal. It’s all about alignment. You might find yourself saying, “do we have alignment?” over and over again as a product manager to the point where you’ll find TikTok videos joking about product managers saying this way too much. Perhaps what makes it so funny is that alignment is so crucial to the role that the job function itself can be distilled into this one word. You’re creating alignment in all ways. You’re aligning leadership, marketing, sales, customer success, operations, finance, engineering, and countless other impacted business functions around the product and helping build something successful that all these teams can be <span class="No-Break">proud of.</span></p>
			<p>This is the emotional part of the role, and it’s one we feel the need to bring up in this section because many product managers might find themselves in the cumbersome task of grappling with AI when they might not know much about it in the first place. The fear that can arise from this is the very essence of why I decided to write this book. In my first role as an ML product manager, I felt fear and its cousin emotions pop up for me. I felt insecure about my own knowledge of AI in the first place. I had a background in data science and ML before my first official role as a product manager. And I still had this fear and uncertainty. I began managing a book club about data science, AI, and ML books to keep this fear at bay. After each book, 23 months and counting, I found myself becoming more and more confident about the subject matter. I then started writing and sharing my own articles as a way to manage the complicated emotions that came up for me as I was managing <span class="No-Break">these products.</span></p>
			<p>When I looked at these emotions objectively, I thought it was funny that I still had reservations about my knowledge and skill set. After all, there aren’t too many product managers out there that have come from the data science and ML space in the first place. Because of this, depending on their level of confidence, I would venture to say that <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>most product managers will likely find themselves grappling with many of the emotions I felt. Particularly in the previous sections, which focus on non-ML native products, I wanted to address the emotional side of the product and give further insight into how to contextualize the power of AI and ML to keep the fears <span class="No-Break">at bay.</span></p>
			<p>So what is there to gain? For starters, bragging rights. It’s still relatively early in the AI game. Outside of the top tech companies, AI adoption is modest. This means that in this phase, and at least for the next few years, the companies that are coming out with AI features for their products are still ahead of the curve, which means it’s arguably the best time for AI feature releases. Coming to market with AI features for your product means you’re able to strive for more market share faster before your competitors get the same idea and send out the same marketing message: <em class="italic">“We’re the only AI-powered X”</em> will only last so long. Across many industries, AI features themselves are the <span class="No-Break">marketing differentiator.</span></p>
			<p>Beyond the marketing, AI features, if implemented properly, should give you a more robust, smarter product. Actual product functionality and results will broaden your product’s reputation and lead to organic growth. If you’re leveraging AI features in a way that helps your product save your customers money, save them time, or make them money faster, then it should be learning from what works. The inherent promise of AI/ML lies in the following equation: data plus models equals more data and better models. Your performance will improve if your data is clean and if your models are updated regularly. Getting more and more familiar with this process will fine-tune your intuition when it comes to your product’s functionality and performance in the market you’re in. As you begin to see progress in the scale and insights your AI features are adding to your product, you’ll begin to anticipate potential issues that can arise with an AI product. This is where some healthy fear is appropriate in your pr<a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>oduct <span class="No-Break">manager role.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Anticipating potential risks</h2>
			<p>Part of the specialization that takes place in the current form of an AI product manager is knowledge of what can go wrong. Your AI features may be taking certain liberties with <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>your customers' data, and it’s your job as a product manager to anticipate the potential risks your product might create for your users. As a product manager, you’re looking to address the most important business problems your users have with your product, but you’re also looking to minimize potential adverse effects. </p>
			<p>We know, we got you all jazzed up about being a fearless AI product manager only to then bring up the things you should be afraid of because we want to make a distinction. We'd rather you be afraid of the potentially harmful side of AI than be afraid of the complexity of AI systems. Understanding the structure and complexity is the easy part. Making sure this complexity is handled properly is the hard part. For example, rather than worrying about where to start with implementing AI features, we would rather you worry about those features having potentially negative effects on your users and customers downstream. This could be related to the choices your AI features are showing your users, decisions it’s making on behalf of your customers, or conclusions it’s arriving at with <span class="No-Break">little explainability.</span></p>
			<p>The inherent responsibility that comes with being a product manager that manages an AI product lies primarily with the amazing impact AI can have. Design and optimization are crucial for AI products. Making sure your product is learning with data samples that are representative and free of bias is easier said than done. Making sure your product is fair and inclusive of all types of users and that your data integrity is healthy is not a straightforward task. You have to also consider downstream effects that would impact your users and customers both immediately and long after interacting with your product. For example, if your product is a dating site, are you able to say the choices you are offering your users are representative of the population of users you have and free <span class="No-Break">of bias?</span></p>
			<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself to ensure you are a responsible steward of your <span class="No-Break">AI product:</span></p>

			<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>how advanced your product organization is, you might have product managers that are focused on individual products as product owners. You might have product managers that focus on the infrastructure and developer tools side. You could be an AI product manager that is more focused on the research side to find new innovations to add to your product line. You could also have a role that is most focused on the responsible building of AI and focus more on the ethics of your product. If you are the only product manager, you’ll have to consider all aspects mentioned above and know a bit <span class="No-Break">about everything.</span></p>
			<p>Even the way we see roles defined now will begin to change. At this point in time, you might find roles such as AI product manager or ML product manager, which articulate the focus on an AI or ML product. Over time, my prediction is that this qualifier will start to go away as all product manager roles mature with AI adoption. As you’ve seen time and again throughout this book, as with the idea that all companies will become AI companies by the end of the decade, the same will hold true for product managers. It will likely be that within 10 years, you’ll have to have some comfort and familiarity with AI in order to be a product manager <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
			<p>The last subject we wanted to touch on in this section is the cost associated with having an AI program in place for you to research, develop, test, and manage your AI activities. As a product manager, you’re not necessarily keeping up with the costs and decisions of how to handle this function in your company, but you’ll need to be familiar with the costs that go into your product. If you’re actively working on developing AI features, this will be one area you’re keeping track of as you build products. Part of your work as a product manager is comparing the costs of certain feature developments with the potential gains from investing in those features. The metrics you <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>choose to demonstrate the value and <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) from the features you’re investing in will make your <span class="No-Break">business case.</span></p>
			<p>AI shouldn’t be <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>a silver bullet. Slapping on an AI tag just for the sake of a competitive marketing edge is not a strategy for success because if AI is not significantly improving your product and is only included as a vanity feature, you’ll eventually find yourself outperformed by products that do leverage AI appropriately. Understanding which AI features to expand on and how they’re improving your product will make your job as an AI product manager easier and you’ll understand this better and better with time. Use your curiosity and experimentation and take intelligent risks. Getting clear on how you can best support your company and what the limitations and benefits of AI/ML are will set you up for success in prioritizing features and planning product strategy. Understanding the potential harms your AI investments might contribute downstream will allow you to build credibility both internally within your company but also externally within <span class="No-Break">your industry.</span></p>
			<p>As an AI product manager, you are creating AI evangelism for your organization. A big part of this indirect influence is actually creating awareness and understanding the growth, the risks, and the inherent opportunity AI offers not only to your product and business but to other stakeholders you work with regularly as well. All roles will be impacted by AI with time. You’re just ahead of the curve, in a sense, because your role is most intimately connected with AI and its potential and you can use this firsthand knowledge to guide your peers through this <a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>transformation <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The AI revolution is happening at many levels, and in this chapter, we took a look at a few of the major areas of how AI is impacting industries as a whole, companies from the inside out, and the role of product managers as well. For the companies finding themselves in industries that are now seeing AI transformation, the first part of this chapter focused on the various areas of AI adoption across industries and how this is affecting the future of work itself. The second part of this chapter focused on how AI is transforming companies themselves and how you can get started at the organizational level to prepare for AI adoption. The third part of this chapter then took these concepts down a level to the product manager-level view and the mindset needed from the product's organization to ensure AI is adopted within a product in a way that ensures integrity and strength <span class="No-Break">moving forward.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will be exploring the various ways we’re seeing AI trending across industries, based on prominent and respected research organizations, in an effort to inspire product managers out there to begin to formulate their strategies for elevating their products into AI products and the considerations they must keep in mind when attempting to <span class="No-Break">approach AI.</span></p>
