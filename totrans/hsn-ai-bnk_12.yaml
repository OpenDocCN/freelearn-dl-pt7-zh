    banking world we will soon be living in. We will also add some useful tips on
    the considerations required to incorporate these AI engines in day-to-day production
    environments. This part corresponds to the business understanding step of the
    CRISP-DM, the approach for implementing any data mining project that we introduced
    in [Chapter 1](1464aff7-9b01-4476-bce9-7da307ef0211.xhtml), *The Importance of

    data prior to processing. The model is built to learn from the labels so that
    labeling will be done automatically with the next set of input data. Unsupervised
    learning, on the other hand, does not label the input data. It does not have labeled
    or trained data. Processing is effected by identifying objects based on patterns
    and repetitions.

    fund future activity that is not completely certain at the time a financial decision
    is made. We are also making a decision regarding our future wealth, which we also
    do not have full control of. What has changed is the speed of update of this risk
