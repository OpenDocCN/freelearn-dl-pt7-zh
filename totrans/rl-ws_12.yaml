    of genetic algorithms and implement them in **Reinforcement Learning** (**RL**).

    with traditional machine learning methods, specifically in the selection of neural

    advantages. In this chapter, we are going to learn about gradient-free methods,
    namely genetic algorithms; develop these algorithms step by step; and use them
    to optimize neural networks and RL-based algorithms. This chapter discusses the
    limitations of gradient-based methods, such as getting stuck at local optima and
    slower convergence when dealing with noisy input. This chapter presents an alternative
    optimization solution to gradient methods through genetic algorithms, as they
    ensure global optimum convergence. You will examine and implement the structure
    of genetic algorithms and implement them through hyperparameter selection for
    neural networks and evolving network topologies, as well as using them in combination
    with RL for a cart-pole balancing activity. Hybrid neural networks that use genetic
    algorithms are used to solve complex problems, such as modeling plasma chemical
    reactors, designing fractal frequency selective surfaces, or optimizing production
    processes. In the following section, you will be examining the problems posed
    by gradient-based methods.

    approaches are used to solve complex decision problems related to **Markov Decision**
    **Processes** (**MDPs**) and **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes**
    (**POMDPs**). Value-based approaches rely on identifying and deriving the optimal
    policy based on the identification of the optimal value function. Algorithms such
    as Q-learning or SARSA(λ) are included within this category, and for tasks involving
    lookup tables, their implementation leads to convergence on a return that is optimal,
    globally. As the algorithms rely on a known model of the environment, for partially
    observable or continuous spaces, there are no guarantees for convergence on a
    solution that is optimal using these value search methods.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, policy-based approaches, instead of relying on the value function
    to maximize the return, use gradient methods (stochastic optimization) to explore
    the policy space. Gradient-based methods or policy gradient methods map the parametrized
    space (environment) to the policy space using loss functions, thus enabling the
    RL agent to explore directly the entirety, or a portion, of the policy space.
    One of the most widely used methods (which is going to be implemented in this
    section) is gradient descent.

    are that they are suitable for POMDPs or non-MDPs, especially for solving robotics
    problems with multiple constraints. However, there are several disadvantages to
    employing gradient-based methods. The most notable one is that algorithms such
    as **REINFORCE** and **DPG** determine a local optimum of the expected reward.
    As the local optimum is found, the RL agent does not expand its search globally.
    For example, a robot solving a maze problem will get stuck in a corner and will
    continuously try to move in the same location. Additionally, when dealing with
    high return variance or noisy input data, algorithm performance is affected as
    they converge slower. This happens when, for instance, a robotic arm is programmed
    to pick up and place a blue component in a tray, but the table has blue hues to
    its color, which interferes with the detection of the component through the sensors
    (such as a camera).

    methods are recommended. These methods include evolutionary algorithms and particle
    swarm optimizations. A characteristic of these methods is that they rely on sets
    of optimization solutions that are commonly referred to as populations. The methods
    rely on iteratively searching for a good solution or a distribution that can solve
    a problem or a mathematical function. The search pattern for the optimal solution
    is modeled based on Darwin's natural selection paradigm and the biological phenomenon
    of genetic evolution. Evolutionary algorithms draw inspiration from biological
    evolution patterns such as mutation, reproduction, recombination, and selection.
    Particle swarm algorithms are inspired by group social behavior, such as a beehive
    organization or ant farms, where single solutions are termed as particles that
    can evolve over time.

    process. Once a fitness criterion is selected, the way in which the selection
    of the parents will be performed needs to be chosen, as does how many children
    will come from the parents. Selection is a vital step in performing genetic evolution,
    as it involves determining the children with the highest fitness. The most common
    way to select the best individuals is by the "survival of the fittest." This means
    the algorithm will improve the population in a step-by-step manner. The convergence
    of the GA is dependent upon the degree to which chromosomes with higher fitness
    are chosen. Therefore, the convergence speed is highly dependent on the successful
    selection of chromosomes. If the chromosomes with the highest fitness are prioritized,
    there is a chance that a sub-optimal solution will be found; if the candidates
    have consistently low fitness, then convergence will be extremely slow.

    relies on randomly assigning binary information in either a set of chromosomes

    by introducing a random change in the population. This technique prevents rapid
    convergence and encourages the exploration of new solutions. In the final steps

    one or more parts of the chromosome or the population are changed. If the probability

    needs to be fully designed. Because the design is pre-set, some neurons may not
    be used in the training process, but they may still be active, therefore making
    them redundant. Additionally, neural networks using gradient methods can become
    stuck at a local optimum, and therefore need to rely on alternative methods to
    help them continue their processes, such as regularization, ridge regression,
    or lasso regression. ANNs are widely used in speech recognition, feature detection

    training neural networks is the quality of the features (or input hyperparameters)
    that are fed to the network. If the parameters are not appropriate, the mapping

    the topology of neural networks, was presented. What sets the NEAT algorithm apart
    from alternative TWEANNs is the way in which mutation, crossover, and selection
    take place to optimize the structure of the neural network, starting from a simple
    network with no hidden layers and evolving into a more complex one with an increased
    number of nodes and connections.

    using robotic arms or carts that are transporting equipment on a shop floor. This
    problem is often generalized as the cart-pole problem. You are going to program
    an automated cart to balance a pole. The goal is to maximize the time that the
    pole is balanced for. To solve this problem, an agent can use a neural network
    for the state-action mapping. The challenge lies in identifying the structure
    of the neural network and a solution for determining the optimal values for the
    weights, bias, and number of neurons for each layer of the neural network. We
    will use a GA to identify the best values for these parameters.

    of algorithm optimization, with an emphasis on the potential of evolutionary algorithms
    – in particular, GAs – to solve optimization problems, such as sub-optimal solutions,
    using a nature-inspired approach. GAs consist of specific elements, such as population
    generation, parent selection, parent reproduction or crossover, and finally mutation
    occurrence, which they use to create a binary optimal solution.

    was explored, helping us to find the most suitable window size and unit number.
    We saw implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms that combined deep neural
    networks and evolutionary strategies, such as NEAT for XNOR output estimation.
    Finally, you had a chance to implement what was studied in this chapter through
    an OpenAI Gym cart-pole simulation, where we examined the application of GAs for
