<p class="calibre2">Machine learning and <strong class="calibre4">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">AI</strong>) have become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we are constantly interacting with AI in one way or another. And neural networks and deep learning are d<span class="calibre5">riving these AI advances</span>. Powered by neural networks, AI systems are now able to achieve human-like performance in many areas.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book provides you with the opportunity to create six different neural network projects from scratch. Through these projects, you will have the opportunity to create some of the AI systems that we commonly see today, including face recognition, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis. In each project, we'll provide a problem statement, the specific neural network architecture to be used to tackle that problem, the reasoning for the choice of neural network used, and the Python code to implement the given solution from scratch. </p>
<p class="calibre2">By the end of the book, you will be well versed in the different neural network architectures, having created cutting edge AI projects in Python that will immediately strengthen your machine learning portfolio.</p>

<p class="calibre2">You should have some basic familiarity with programming in Python in order to get the most out of this book. Nevertheless, t<span class="calibre5">he book will take you through every step in the project and explain the code as much as possible. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">In terms of hardware, you should be running the code on a fairly modern computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and 15 GB of hard disk space (for the datasets).</span> <span class="calibre5">Training deep neural networks requires strong computational resources, and can be sped up significantly if you have a dedicated GPU. However, it is perfectly fine to run the code without a GPU, as well (such as on a laptop). Throughout the book, we will alert you if certain code will take some time to run if you do not have a GPU. </span></p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">At the start of each chapter, we will inform you of the necessary Python libraries required for the project. To simplify the set-up process, we have provided an <kbd class="calibre13">environment.yml</kbd> file together with the code. The <kbd class="calibre13">environment.yml</kbd> file allows you to easily set up a virtual environment with the specific Python version and the requisite libraries installed in it. This way, you can be assured that your code will be running in a standardized virtual environment that we have designed. Detailed instructions will be provided in <a href="1068b86b-d786-48ba-b91c-35d0ff569460.xhtml" target="_blank" class="calibre10">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="calibre5"> </span><em class="calibre8">Machine Learning and Neural Networks 101</em><span class="calibre5">,</span> under the <em class="calibre8">Setting up your computer for machine learning </em><span class="calibre5">section</span>, as well as at the start of each chapter.</p>
