    many managers struggle with understanding what makes their products different
    and better, which can result in missed opportunities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    complexity of measurement, limited datasets being available for analysis, a lack
    of domain expertise required to understand patterns, and a lack of reliable metrics
    that can be applied across multiple product lines. These challenges have made
    it difficult for companies to effectively develop new products and services.

    associated with product attributes – through the lens of innovation in consumer
    goods. One intriguing finding from our research is that attributes such as taste
    or brand expectations play an important role in shaping purchase behavior behind
    consumer goods brands.

    a higher price tag alongside an interesting design aesthetic rather than the standard
    knockoff experience you'd expect from buying a bag off the discount rack at a
    department store.
  prefs: []

- en: Similarly, one reason **Starbucks** has been so successful is not just its focus
    on premium coffee but also the expectation among its customers that it will create
    interesting new flavors through its roasting technology, rather than it rehashing
    old favorites time after time. The same logic applies when looking at technology
    firms versus commodity vendors – there's something interesting happening here
    that warrants further investigation.

    features. In short, AI offers real promise in this context by augmenting traditional
    market surveillance capabilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The art and science of product innovation have always been about finding new
    ways to satisfy customer needs and desires – and generating revenue along the
    way. Disruptive innovations often succeed by taking market share away from depleted
    or disrupted incumbents. Such disruption requires an ability to identify opportunities
    by their revenue opportunity.

    obvious in retrospect, help you to prioritize investments in uncertain areas,

    try to understand who exactly uses your product and what they're trying to accomplish
    with it. By doing this, you'll be able to build features – or at least concepts
    for building features – that resonate with the users you already have, rather
    than seeking out new users that might not even exist yet.

    and how to influence it is critical for driving innovation, increasing engagement,
    and reducing churn.

    as revenue, user engagement, or **cost of customer acquisition** (**CAC**). While
    these are useful metrics to track over time, they often fail to tell the whole
    story. In particular, CAC fails to account for the value of having engaged users
    (that is, those who remain active every day) further down the line.
