    A thoughtful implementation of AI can do wonders in automating business functions. AI has
    the power to transform a wide variety of industries through its application. As
    computer systems have evolved over time, they have become very powerful. Consequently,
    machines have also become very powerful and can perform many complicated tasks
    with ease. For example, **Optical Character Recognition** (**OCR**) is a task
    that even personal computers can perform easily with the help of software. However,
    OCR requires intelligence to translate dots from an image into characters. So,
    in an ideal case, OCR will be considered an area of AI. However, because of the
    power of machines, we tend to not consider it as an application of AI.'

    banking. Banking is an industry or domain that is extremely diversified and complex. To
    simplify complex banking functions, the banking industry requires a constant supply
    of advanced technological solutions. As shown in a recent analysis conducted by
    Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/12/05/how-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-financial-institutions/#2e989fae460a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/12/05/how-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-financial-institutions/#2e989fae460a)),
    the implementation of AI in various banking processes will save the industry more
    than $1 trillion by 2030. Consequently, the banking industry will benefit the
    most from AI systems in the near future.

    an excellent example of deep learning in banking. Such applications (that is,
    chatbots) are powerful when it comes to understanding the context of customer
    requests, preferences, and interests. The chatbot is connected to backend applications
    that interact with data stores. Based on the customer's inputs or selection of
    services, the chatbot presents to the customer various alternative sub-services
    to choose from.

    to learning a language. For instance, once a person masters the alphabet by rigorously
    learning how to identify each letter uniquely, they will be eligible to move on
    to the next layer of complexity—words. The person will start learning small words
    and then long words. Upon mastering words, the person will start forming sentences,
    understanding grammatical concepts at different layers of complexity. Once they
    reach the top of this hierarchy of layers of complexity, the person will be able
    to master the language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might have noticed that in each phase or layer of the hierarchy, the learning
    becomes more complex. Each layer is built based on the learning or knowledge gathered
    from the previous layer of complexity. This is how deep learning works. The program
    keeps on learning, forming more knowledge with new layers of complexity based
    on the knowledge received from the previous layer. The layered complexity is where
    the word *deep* was taken from. Deep learning is a type of unsupervised learning,
    so it is much faster than supervised learning.

    purposes, from the protection of asset values to appreciation. They are typically
    referred to as the **buy side**, which represents the asset owners, while the
    banking services that help the buy side are referred to as the **sell side**,
    which typically includes securities sales (client-facing, gathering orders), trading
    (executing the orders), and research (evaluating the securities).

    be important as well. The stronger the investment performance of the insurer,
    the more aggressive the pricing of insurance it can offer and the more competitive
    it becomes. That's one of the reasons why Berkshire Hathaway can provide competitive
    insurance pricing—due to its superior investment performance.

    banks can also offer derivatives as a financial instrument to offer risk protection. The

    Foreign exchange came in second with $87 trillion of outstanding exposure, which
    is roughly equal to the world's GDP. Commodity, credit, and equity derivatives
    have smaller shares, with each at around 2% to 9% equivalent of GDP. When accounting
    for derivatives as a risk-protection instrument, we exclude a form of derivatives
    called the interest rate **over-the-counter** (**OTC**), which is equal to 6 times
    the annual income—this is far more than the annual income that our wealth requires
    for protection. Indeed, some investors take the interest rate OTC as an investment.
    We carve out this instrument for our overall understanding of insurance. OTC refers
    to the bilateral agreements between banks and bank customers.
