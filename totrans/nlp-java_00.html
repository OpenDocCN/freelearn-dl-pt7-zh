He served on my advisory board until his untimely death, and I miss him terribly.</p><p>Fellow Aristotelian, Bob Carpenter, is the architect and developer behind the LingPipe API. It was his idea to make LingPipe open source, which opened many doors and led to this book.</p><p>Mitzi Morris has worked with us over the years and has been instrumental in our challenging NIH work, the author of tutorials, packages, and pitching in where it was needed.</p><p>Jeff Reynar was my office mate in graduate school when we hatched the idea of entering the MUC-6 competition, which was the prime mover for creation of the company; he now serves our advisory board.</p><p>Our volunteer reviewers deserve much credit; Doug Donahue and Rob Stupay were a big help. Packt Publishing reviewers made the book so much better; I thank Karthik Raghunathan, Altaf Rahman, and Kshitij Judah for their attention to detail and excellent questions and suggestions.</p><p>Our editors were the ever patient; Ruchita Bhansali who kept the chapters moving and provided excellent commentary, and Shiny Poojary, our thorough technical editor, who suffered so that you don't have to. Much thanks to both of you.</p><p>I could not have done this without my co-author, Krishna, who worked full-time and held up his side of the writing.</p><p>Many thanks to my wife, Karen, for her support throughout the book-writing process.</p></div></div><p>

Thank you, Bob! I'd also like to thank my co-author, Breck, for convincing me to co-author this book and for tolerating all my quirks throughout the writing process.</p><p>I'd like to thank the reviewers, Karthik Raghunathan, Altaf Rahman, and Kshitij Judah, for providing essential feedback, which in some cases changed the entire recipe. Many thanks to Ruchita, our editor at Packt Publishing, for guiding, cajoling, and essentially making sure that this book actually came to be. Finally, thanks to Latha for her support, encouragement, and tolerance.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
