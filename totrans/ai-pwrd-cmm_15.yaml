    particular, they're always seeking opportunities to improve **User Experience**
    (**UX**). Unfortunately, there's often a big gap between what the product team
    wants and what customers actually need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which features to build first, second, and third – or not at all! It can be challenging
    for product teams without any kind of formal process or structured criteria to
    work with. This is where **product prioritization surveys** come in handy. They're
    a quick and easy way for product teams to collect feedback from users while also
    identifying which features should get top priority next.

    survey, how it works, and who takes part in these surveys.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the purpose of a product feature prioritization survey?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A survey such as this is useful because it directly engages with customers as
    part of your product development process. Rather than solely spending time researching
    competitors' offerings or coming up with ideas on your own, you can leverage existing
    customer insights so that your ideas are informed by what people actually want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also gives you data directly from real people you know more about than anyone
    else – namely, actual buyers who are already in the marketplace. This is invaluable
    because it allows you to understand exactly what people want, what they think
    about features, and other insights that can't be gleaned from solely researching
    competitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies that fail to get feedback such as this can end up making products
    that don't satisfy their users' needs and missing out on valuable opportunities
    for greater brand loyalty. For example, a large consumer electronics firm recently
    updated its laptop line, adding all the features that users had been requesting
    for several years. They've come under criticism for taking so long to deliver
    on these features, and for essentially building the same laptop over and over
    again. A product feature prioritization survey would have revealed these improvement
    opportunities early on.

    quickly and easily identify which features to build next based on customer feedback.
    The format is simple, and the information you provide will help you prioritize
    the product backlog for your team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will review both the responses and preferences of users, as well as any existing
    market research or competitive analysis. This will give you a clear picture of
    what features you should work on building first, second, third, and so on.
  prefs: []

    which is how some of the largest e-commerce companies communicate directly with
    their customers. Since customers are the lifeblood of your business, you should
    always aim to get feedback from them. If you don't, you run the risk of releasing
    a new feature that no one wants.

    the needs of your target customers, as well as the risks and challenges they face.
    A structured approach to customer research helps teams develop a foundation for
    their offering, find early adopters, and gain insights that can inform the future
    development of their services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which are an invaluable tool for gaining insights into a user's motivations and
    behaviors. However, conducting individual interviews can be costly and time-consuming.
    In addition, qualitative research methods such as observation and analysis often
    yield limited results, due to their low capacity for generating actionable insights
    that can inform the service innovation life cycle.
  prefs: []

    a primary method for understanding customer needs and preferences. Voice surveys
    allow you to reach large audiences at a minimal cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and want to understand how customers prefer to order their food. You could conduct
    individual interviews, but this would be costly and time-consuming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to reach many more customers at a lower cost and take as little as a few minutes
    to complete. You could also use the results of your survey to guide the development
    of new features that may improve customer experience and increase revenue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example is a retail store that wants to understand the items that customers
    are most interested in purchasing via a voice survey. The store could then use
    this information to develop new product lines and promote those items in its checkout
    aisles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    additional value. As you can see, voice surveys provide service teams with a powerful
    tool for developing products and services that align with customer needs while

    expect an instant response to their questions and concerns, or they'll simply
    look somewhere else for help or advice.

    their room not yet made up when they finally get there.

    strategy, but few have a robust conversation around it. Pricing is ultimately
    about creating an equilibrium between your cost of goods and the value that customers
