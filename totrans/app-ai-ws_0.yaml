- en: You already know that **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**) and **Machine Learning**
    (**ML**) are present in many of the tools you use in your daily routine. But do
    you want to be able to create your own AI and ML models and develop your skills
    in these domains to kickstart your AI career?

- en: '*The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop* gets you started with applying
    AI with the help of practical exercises and useful examples, all put together
    cleverly to help you gain the skills to transform your career.'

- en: The book begins by teaching you how to predict outcomes using regression. You'll
    then learn how to classify data using techniques such as **K-Nearest Nneighbor**
    (**KNN**) and **Support Vector Machine** (**SVM**) classifiers. As you progress,
    you'll explore various decision trees by learning how to build a reliable decision
    tree model that can help your company find cars that clients are likely to buy.
    The final chapters will introduce you to deep learning and neural networks. Through
    various activities, such as predicting stock prices and recognizing handwritten
    digits, you'll learn how to train and implement **Convolutional Neural Networks**
    (**CNN**s) and **Recurrent Neural Networks** (**RNN**s).

    and train neural networks, and be able to use various techniques to develop AI
    and ML models.

- en: '*The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop* is designed for software developers
    and data scientists who want to enrich their projects with machine learning. Although
    you do not need any prior experience in AI, it is recommended that you have knowledge
    of high-school-level mathematics and at least one programming language, preferably
    Python. While this is a beginner''s book, experienced students and programmers
    can also improve their Python programming skills by focusing on the practical
    applications featured in this AI book.'

    is a Python library and can be installed in the same way as the other Python libraries
    – that is, with `pip install jupyter`, but fortunately, it comes pre-installed
    with Anaconda. To open a notebook, simply run the command `jupyter notebook` in
    the Terminal or Command Prompt.
