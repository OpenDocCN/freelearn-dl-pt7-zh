- en: In the previous chapters, we have discussed how you can use Amazon Textract
    and Amazon Comprehend to automate your existing document processing workflows
    with AWS AI services. We covered some of the key use cases such as using Comprehend
    to analyze SEC filing reports and using Textract to extract text from any document
    or quickly digitize any document. We also spoke about how these AI services provide
    a confidence score with each predicted text, word, line, or entity. Now, the questions
    that customers often ask are about how to improve these predictions and to make
    sure they are highly accurate. In most AI systems, it's either AI doing the automation
    process or it's only humans or manual processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ideal scenario would be both humans and AI working together so that the
    results predicted by these AI systems can be reviewed by humans to make sure they
    are highly accurate. This applies to scenarios where we are processing highly
    critical information in our document processing workflows, for example, processing
    loan applications, invoice processing, mortgage processing, or legal documents
    reviews, and so on. In all of these scenarios, you would want a human to validate
    or review whether the loan amount or invoice amount predicted by the ML or AI
    systems was accurate because if it was not, one zero could change your life! It
    could lead to millions in losses for the organization. Also, in the case of low-confidence
    predictions, you would also want to have the AI-predicted information checked
    over by a human reviewer. For example, in the case of claims processing, if your
    ML system has predicted a low confidence score for a claim, you would want to
    reject or approve the claim based on a human review. This working of humans and
    AI/ML together builds trust with the process and it also reduces the time to market
    for the overall document processing solution.

- en: In this chapter, we covered how you can improve the accuracy of your current
    document processing workflows when using Amazon Textract for automating these
    document workflows. We introduced Amazon A2I and how it can help improve the accuracy
    of your text predictions and can be integrated with Amazon Textract to set up
    a human review workflow. We also discussed how A2I can be used for model retraining
    with custom models to improve accuracy, which we will cover in the next chapter.
