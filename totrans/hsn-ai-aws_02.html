                    <h1 class="header-title">What is AI?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AI is an umbrella term that describes a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent agents. The field of AI is highly technical and specialized; there is a broad set of theories, methods, and technologies in AI that allow computers to see (computer vision), to hear (speech recognition), to understand (natural language processing), to speak (text-to-speech), and to think (knowledge reasoning and planning).</p>
<p>It may seem that AI is a buzzword of our current times, but it has existed since the 1950s, when early work on artificial neural networks that mimic led the human brain stirred up excitement for thinking machines. With all the fanfare it receives in the media today, it is hard to believe that this field had to endure two AI winters, where interest in AI research and development dwindled. Today, AI has become popular again, thanks to the increased volume of data, cheaper storage, advancements in algorithms, and an increase in computing power.</p>
<p>One of the most important subfields of AI is <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>). ML is such a prominent part of AI that these two terms are often used interchangeably today. ML is the most promising set of techniques to achieve AI. These techniques gave us a new way to program computers through self-learning algorithms that can derive knowledge from data. We can train ML models that can look for patterns and draw conclusions like humans would. With these self-learning algorithms, the data itself has become the most valuable asset. Data has become the competitive advantage in industries; it is the new intellectual property. Between similar ML techniques (even inferior ML techniques), the best data will win.</p>
<p>What's old is new again. Artificial neural networks, once again, became the focus for ML research and development. More data, more compute, and new algorithms such as backpropagation, are enabling neural networks to have many hidden layers, also known as deep neural networks or deep learning. The increase in the accuracy of deep neural network models was almost impossible just a few years ago. Today, deep learning is the major breakthrough that is driving the modern-day AI boom. This combination of data, software, and hardware is creating a new breed of intelligent agents that can often see, hear, understand, speak, and even think like humans when provided with abundant information that is related to the world.</p>
<p>AI has become a vital part of the technology landscape. Businesses, big and small, are solving problems by leveraging AI. AI capabilities are seeping into every aspect of our lives, giving us better memory, better vision, better cognitive abilities, and much more. In most cases, AI will not be sold as the product by itself. Rather, products you already use will be improved with AI, and will become intelligent-enabled solutions. What is most exciting to us is the democratization of AI and ML technologies and services. The abundance of such technologies and services means practitioners can easily leverage AI to add intelligence to products that affects the way we live, work, and play.</p>
<p>This book will help you become an AI practitioner. We will teach you, through hands-on projects, the tools and techniques that are needed to embed AI capabilities into software solutions. Successful intelligent-enabled solutions require a combination of architecture design, software engineering, and data science. You will learn how to design, develop, deploy, and maintain production-grade software solutions with AI capabilities. As an AI practitioner, it is important to see AI through the lens of business capabilities, rather than just technologies. This book aims to bring together various skills to help you develop an intuition for well-designed intelligent-enabled solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Our lives have already been greatly impacted by applications of AI, including the way we search for information, shop for products, communicate with each other, and much more. However, we are only in the nascency of this intelligent software renaissance. So many amazing AI applications already exist, so let's look at a few examples.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One AI application that's getting much media attention is autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars. These vehicles are capable of perceiving the world around them, and drive with little or no human intervention.</p>
<p>These autonomous vehicles are the perfect fusion of sensors and AI technologies that have been combined to create the self-driving capability. To develop the self-driving capability, these vehicles have logged millions of miles on highways and local roads, and billions more in simulations. Gobs of data coming from arrays of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, and many more, are used to train numerous ML models to perform the various perception and actuation tasks that are required to move vehicles safely in real-world conditions. The resulting AI capabilities, such as computer vision, object detection, predictive modeling, and obstacle avoidance algorithms, can create complex models of the environment that onboard computers can understand in order to control, to plot paths, and to navigate.</p>
<p>Self-driving technology is less error-prone than human drivers, and can potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives from crashes and accidents. This technology can also be a mobility provider for individuals who are unable to drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled. At the time of writing, there are no true fully autonomous vehicles in large deployment in the world. We can't even imagine how this technology will reshape and mold our world in the decades to come.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AI and ML is starting to transform the healthcare industry. These technologies are being used to improve diagnostic capabilities and clinical decision-making to speed up the detection and treatment of many diseases. These AI programs do not just follow preprogrammed guidelines for how to diagnose a disease. Instead, the AI is <em>taught</em> to recognize the symptoms of particular medical conditions, such as heart arrhythmias, diabetes-related vision loss, and even cancer.</p>
<p>A medical image is a rich source of data about a patient's health. With high-resolution images from X-rays, MRIs, and CAT scans, ML models can be trained with millions of example images labeled with particular medical conditions. With sufficient examples, the resulting ML models can diagnose diseases with accuracies that rival, if not surpass, human doctors. With AI programs tirelessly analyzing for valuable medical insights, they can aid doctors with faster and more accurate diagnoses, and the patients can receive treatment sooner.</p>
<p>More profoundly, the resulting AI capabilities incorporate the knowledge and experience of the best doctors and clinicians that helped to develop these capabilities. Once developed, the capabilities can be massively replicated and distributed to primary care offices and walk-in clinics, where this level of medical expertise was previously inaccessible. This can save thousands of lives through the early detection and treatment of diseases. It will have a profound impact on people's lives, especially in locations of the world where specialized doctors are scarce.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While there is a lot of excitement in ground-breaking, revolutionary, and even moon-shot AI applications that will no doubt change our world, you don't always have to chase after these fundamentally difficult problems to bring value to our world with AI.</p>
<p>One good example of an apt intelligent-enabled solution for a recent real-world problem is predictive keyboards on mobile devices. When touchscreen mobile devices became popular, we had to learn to type on small virtual keyboards, often on the go, with fewer fingers and with more distractions. These predictive keyboards facilitated faster typing by suggesting words and punctuation that we may wish to type, thus reducing friction in mobile communication.</p>
<p>The predictive capabilities of these keyboards are often built with ML and <strong>natural language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>) technologies that combine language models, custom dictionaries, and learned preferences in their prediction engines. The best prediction engines are likely built using a form of <strong>recurrent neural network</strong> (<strong>RNN</strong>) called <strong>long short-term memory</strong> (<strong>LSTM</strong>). These are neural networks that try to predict the next word given a window of previously typed words. The key to a successful prediction is in its speed and personalization. Each key press results in a prediction, and so the prediction engines must run fast on mobile hardware. These prediction engines are designed to get more intelligent as we use them; they are good examples of human-in-the-loop online learning systems.</p>
<p>Even though they are not saving lives by the thousands, the users of these predictive keyboards have saved trillions of keystrokes. We just love the elegance of these intelligent-enabled software solutions that have applied the right AI technologies to the right problems. We hope that, with the skills and insights you will have gained from this book, you will be able to find elegant AI applications to make our lives better, as well.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why use Amazon Web Services for AI?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> or <strong>AWS</strong> is by far the largest, most comprehensive cloud computing platform. AWS offers a broad set of on-demand cloud-based services, including compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and much more. For many years, developers have leveraged these services to build enterprise-grade software solutions at scale and speed that cannot be matched by any other cloud computing platform.</p>
<p>What's exciting is that AWS also offers a plethora of AI services that provide pre-trained AI capabilities, including image recognition, NLP, speech recognition and generation, and conversation agents. AWS also has ML services that simplify the building, training, and deployment of custom AI capabilities via ML and deep learning models. Companies and developers can leverage these AI and ML services to add intelligence to their software solutions just as easily as with AWS' other cloud computing services.</p>
<p>However, the true power of developing intelligent-enabled solutions on AWS is unlocked when developers combine the AWS AI and ML services with the rest of the AWS cloud computing ecosystem. By combining various AWS services, you instantly get access to an enterprise-grade cloud computing platform with a highly reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure. This enables you, the AI practitioner, to easily collect and process large datasets so that you can integrate various AI capabilities, rapidly prototype ideas, and continuously experiment and iterate solutions.</p>
<p>As the title of this book suggests, this is a hands-on guide. We aim to bring together the various skills that are needed to design and build end-to-end AI solutions on the AWS platform. The keyword here is <em>skills</em>. We not only cover the important concepts of AI, but we also help you put these concepts into practice with numerous hands-on projects. It is only through these practical hands-on experiences that you will develop an intuition for well-designed, intelligent-enabled solutions. The projects in this book can be deployed to the AWS cloud platform; you can learn from them, you can enhance them, and you can even showcase them to others.</p>
<p>Working within the enormous AWS ecosystem will require a steep learning curve. New users can easily be overwhelmed by the AWS offerings. In this book, we will teach you about the patterns and practices that are needed to develop intelligent-enabled solutions, along with many of the services offered by the AWS platform. You will become intimately familiar with many of the AWS services and their <strong>application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>). Not only will you build working applications, but you will also understand the choices of the services and patterns that are being used. Along the way, we will also show you tips and tricks for working on the AWS platform.</p>
<p>AWS is composed of a huge number of services, and it is still growing. There are countless books and online resources that dive deeper into various subsets of these services. In this book, we will be focusing on some of the AWS services that work well together to help you build intelligent-enabled applications. We will cover most of the ML services, as well as various services for compute, storage, networking, and databases. Keep in mind that it is beyond the scope of this book to cover all the aspects of these services, let alone every AWS service.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of AWS AI offerings</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>To better understand AWS AI offerings, we can group the services into two main groups.</span></p>
<p><span>The following diagram shows the subsets of AWS AI capabilities and AWS ML platforms that we will be covering in this book, organized by the two groups:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ed0dbd0d-265b-444a-842c-f93ab92375f9.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_infobox">The list of AWS ML services is growing every year. For example, Amazon Personalize, Forecast, Textract, and DeepRacer were announced at the <em>AWS re:Invent 2018</em> conference, and were <span>in limited preview</span>. These services became available for general use around mid 2019.</div>
<p>The first group in the preceding diagram are the AWS AI capabilities. These services are built on top of AWS pre-trained AI technologies. They work right <em>out of the box</em> to provide ready-made intelligence for your applications. You do not need to understand the AI techniques that make them tick, and you do not need to maintain the infrastructure to host them. AWS has done all the hard work for you, and has made these AI capabilities available via APIs. As AWS continuously improve these capabilities, your application will automatically get more intelligent without any effort on your part. These managed services can provide quick lifts to your applications, thus allowing intelligent solutions to be built quickly and economically.</p>
<p>These AWS AI capabilities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Comprehend:</strong> A NLP service that uses ML to find insights and relationships in text. This technology allows your applications to sift through mountains of unstructured text and dig up golden nuggets of information. This service can perform various tasks, including automatic classification of documents; identification of entities such as company names, people, and addresses; and extraction of topics, key phrases, and sentiments within the text.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Lex:</strong> A service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice or text. This capability is built using deep learning techniques such as <strong>automatic speech recognition</strong> (<strong>ASR</strong>) and <strong>natural language understanding</strong> (<strong>NLU</strong>) in order to convert speech into text and to recognize intents within text. This is the same technology that is behind the Amazon Alexa voice assistant, and the same capability can be embedded into your own applications.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Polly:</strong> A service that turns text into life-like speech that allows you to add a human voice to your application. The text-to-speech technology that is behind this service uses advanced deep learning technologies that can synthesize a voice with different languages, genders, and accents.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Rekognition:</strong> A service that can analyze images and videos in order to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. This service can also provide accurate facial analysis and recognition for various applications. The deep learning technology behind this service has been trained on billions of images and videos for a high level of accuracy on a variety of analysis tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Transcribe:</strong> An ASR service that provides speech-to-text capabilities to your applications. This technology allows your applications to analyze stored audio files or live audio streams, and get transcription text in real time.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Translate:</strong> A neural machine translation service that delivers natural and fluent language translation. This service is backed by deep learning models that can provide accurate and natural sounding translations for many languages. You can even configure this service with custom language models that can include brand names, product names, and other custom terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second group in the preceding diagram are the AWS ML platforms. These services are fully managed infrastructures and toolsets that help developers build and run their custom AI capabilities via ML. AWS provides the development constructs and handles the ML training compute resources in order to make developing custom AI capabilities easier. The AI practitioners are responsible for designing the inner workings of these AI capabilities. This might include: the collection and cleaning of training data; selection of ML libraries and algorithms; tuning and optimization of ML models; and designing and the development of interfaces to access the AI capabilities. Leveraging the AWS ML platforms to build custom AI capabilities is definitely more involved than using the managed AI services, but this group of services gives you the most flexibility to create innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The AWS ML platform we will be covering in this book is: <strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong>—A fully managed service that covers the entire ML workflow. With SageMaker, you can collect and process your training data; you can choose your ML algorithms and ML libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, Scikit-learn, and so on; you can train the ML models on ML-optimized compute resources; and you can tune and deploy the resulting models to provide AI capabilities that are specifically created for your applications.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">We highly recommend that you leverage the AWS-managed AI services as much as you can first. Only when there is a need for custom AI capabilities should you then build them with the AWS AI ML platform.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>Without further ado, let's get our hands dirty with a few AWS services. The services that we will use and the tasks that we will perform in this section will set you up for intelligent-enabled application development on AWS.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>If you don't already have an account with AWS, you can sign up for one at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a> and then click on the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button. You will see the following screen:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/403f0134-f0dc-4648-bbbe-e275d86d07dc.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Your AWS account gives you access to all services in AWS on demand. But don't worry – with AWS' pay-as-you-go pricing model, you only pay for the services that you actually use, at industry-leading affordable prices. If this is the first time you are signing up for an AWS account, your account automatically includes 12 months of free tier access. The free tier offers a certain amount of AWS services for free, including compute, storage, database, and API calls. There are even non-expiring free resources after the 12 month free tier period. Visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">https://aws.amazon.com/free</a> for more details.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Navigating through the AWS Management Console</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now, let's get familiar with the AWS Management Console. The first time you log in to your AWS account, you will see the AWS Management Console. It might look something like the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3587cef8-2520-4995-bca7-f2600280c74f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The AWS Management Console is a web interface where you manage the AWS cloud platform. Through this console, you can start, monitor, and stop various resources such as cloud compute and cloud storage; you can manage your AWS account settings, including monthly billing, and fine-grained access control; and you can even get access to educational resources to help you get started on the various services that are offered.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The AWS Management Console is one of three ways you can interact with the AWS cloud platform. The other two methods are the AWS <strong>Command-line Interface</strong> or <strong>CLI</strong> and the AWS <strong>Software Development Kit</strong> or <strong>SDK</strong>. We will cover these other methods later in this chapter.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>On the AWS Management Console, you can click on the <strong>Services</strong> tab at the top-left corner of the console. Here, you will see the plethora of AWS services organized into groups. You can also search for services by name; searching is usually the faster way to navigate to a particular service that you are looking for.</p>
<p>Your <strong>Services</strong> tab should look similar to this:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Choosing the AWS region</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Not every AWS service that you see in the list is available in every AWS region. AWS is a global cloud infrastructure that is built around the concept of AWS regions. An AWS region is a physical location in the world where you can operate your cloud applications. Depending on the region in which you choose to operate, some services might not be available. For example, when we created our account, the region defaulted to US East (Ohio). At the time of writing, the Ohio region does not have the Amazon Lex service.</p>
<p>If a service is not available in a region, you will see a <strong>Region Unsupported</strong> message, similar to this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6cbcad30-ef60-43de-9377-60dfdb8a6920.png" style=""/></div>
<p>For this book, we recommend that you change the region to <strong>US East</strong> (<strong>N. Virginia</strong>), also known as region <strong>us-east-1</strong>. This Northern Virginia region has all of the AWS services available, and it is also the region that gets the newest AWS services first.</p>
<p>Select the Northern Virginia region by clicking on the region name next to your AWS account name. It is important for you to do this to ensure that the examples and projects in this book are consistent. The <strong>US East (N. Virginia)</strong> region is the first choice in the following screenshot:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's try out one of the AWS-managed AI services, Amazon Rekognition, to get a feel for the power of AWS's AI offerings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Rekognition</strong> from the list of services under <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to navigate to its home page.</li>
<li>Rekognition provides a collection of visual analyses for images and videos. With Rekognition, you can quickly add powerful capabilities to detect objects, faces, and text in images and videos. You do not need to understand the deep learning technologies behind these capabilities in order to add them to your applications. We will create several such applications in the hands-on projects throughout this book, but for now, let's see Rekognition's capabilities in action with one of the provided demos.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>From the Amazon Rekognition home page's left-hand pane, click on <strong>Object and scene detection</strong> under the <strong>Demos</strong> section.</li>
<li>AWS has already provided a couple of sample images to show off the power of Rekognition. In one of the images, you and I can easily see that a skateboarder is performing a trick on a road with two rows of parked cars on either side. This is actually a pretty busy image for computers to perform analysis on.</li>
<li>So, how did Rekognition do? Rekognition has drawn boxes around the objects that it has detected, and you can mouse over the boxes in order to see what Rekognition thinks each object is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the Rekognition demo page with the skateboarder image detection results:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/18d917db-bb3d-4c7a-8ff1-c8f6813a7e14.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>On the right-hand side of the image, under <strong>Results</strong>, Rekognition also provides the confidence levels for all the objects that it has detected.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also <strong>Request</strong> and <strong>Response</strong> underneath the confidence levels. In fact, this demo page is actually making API calls to Rekognition's object and scene detection API on your behalf. If you expand the request, it reveals some details about the API call:</p>
<pre>{<br/> "Image": {<br/>   "S3Object": {<br/>        "Bucket": "console-sample-images",<br/>        "Name": "skateboard.jpg"<br/>    }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre>
<p>The request is in the <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> or <strong>JSON</strong> format. The request specifies an image that is to be analyzed by the Rekognition API. More specifically, this is an image that's stored as an object in the <span>Amazon</span> <strong>Simple Storage Service</strong> or <strong>S3</strong>. From the request, we can tell that the image is stored in the <kbd>console-sample-images</kbd> bucket, with the name of <kbd>skateboard.jpg</kbd>.</p>
<p>This demo application is using the <span>Amazon </span>S3 service to store the sample images, and Rekognition can directly analyze images that are stored in S3. We will be leveraging this pattern in many of the projects in later chapters as well. As we mentioned earlier, the power of the AWS ecosystem is the interoperability of many of its services.</p>
<p>The response is also in JSON format. The response contains a lot of information about the objects that were detected in the sample image. This information includes the name of the object, the confidence of the detection, and even the coordinates for the bounding box where each object is located within the image. In our projects, we will learn how to process such JSON responses in order to use the results in our intelligent-enabled applications.</p>
<p>In this demo, you can also upload your own images to test out Rekognition. Find an image and give it a try. When you upload your image to the demo page, you will notice that the request that is sent to the API is slightly different. In the request, you will see the following:</p>
<pre>{<br/>   "Image": {<br/>     "Bytes”: “...”<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>This time, instead of specifying an image in S3, the raw bytes of the image that was uploaded were sent directly to the <span>Rekognition </span>API. This Rekognition API has multiple variations: one that takes reference to an S3 object and another that takes the raw bytes of an image. Which variation you choose depends on the nature of your application.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The Amazon S3 service is one of the first services that was offered by AWS. S3 provides secure, durable, and scalable object storage at a very low cost. Object storage just means that the things you store in S3 are accessible at the file level, instead of at the block or byte level. S3 is a very flexible service, with many usage patterns. You can read more about Amazon S3 at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">https://aws.amazon.com/s3</a>.</p>
<p>Let's start working with <span>Amazon </span>S3 by creating a bucket. You can think of a bucket as a folder that can hold an unlimited number of files (objects).</p>
<p>Navigate to the Amazon S3 home page from the Amazon Management Console by clicking on the <strong>Services</strong> tab in the top-left corner, and then click or search for <strong>S3</strong> under <strong>Storage</strong>. If this is your first time using S3, you will see a screen similar to this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d7e2ebe2-d61f-4af1-bdfe-e485c7cd2ad5.png" style=""/></div>
<p>In this book, we will be leveraging S3 a lot in our hands-on projects. We will be using S3 for three main purposes. The first purpose is storing media files and other contents for other AWS services to access. Many of the AWS AI services are tightly integrated with S3; for example, this is the pattern that we have seen in the Rekognition demo. The second purpose is hosting entire static websites with S3, including HTML files, images, videos, and client-side JavaScript. This gives us the ability to host interactive web applications without the need for traditional web servers. The third purpose is using S3 as a data store for data collection, processing, and analytics tasks when we train our custom ML models.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">There is a range of S3 storage classes that have been redesigned for different use cases and cost levels. For your enterprise-grade application, you might need to take advantage of the different storage classes in order to balance performance and cost. In this book, we will be using the Amazon S3 standard class for general-purpose storage. This is the default class and it will be sufficient for the projects in this book.</div>
<p>Click on the <strong>Create bucket</strong> button to create a new bucket:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2f979d10-06ee-4d44-b67d-b158865ef69a.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The first screen in the model asks for three pieces of information: the <strong>Bucket name</strong>, the <strong>Region</strong>, and <strong>Copy settings from an existing bucket</strong>. Since this is your first bucket, we can ignore the third piece of information.</p>
<p>The S3 bucket name must be globally unique. This means that every bucket that's ever created by you and others must have a unique name. Coming up with a globally unique bucket name can be challenging; you cannot expect bucket names such as <kbd>contents</kbd>, <kbd>website</kbd>, or <kbd>data</kbd> to still be available. The S3 bucket names must be DNS-compliant so that you can follow similar patterns for the domain names. For example, if we choose <kbd>aws.ai</kbd> as our root domain, we can create buckets such as <kbd>contents.aws.ai</kbd>, <kbd>website.aws.ai</kbd>, and <kbd>data.aws.ai</kbd> to avoid conflicts. Think about which root domain you would like to use.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You don't have to own the domain to name the buckets with a given root domain name; however, if you do own a domain, it would be a good idea to use that as your root domain.</div>
<p>You must also specify the region of your bucket. This will determine in which physical region in the world your objects will be stored. The AWS regions are completely isolated from each other by design. Objects stored in one region cannot be accessed by services and applications running in a different region. This can be important if your line of business has high-performance requirements that need your applications and data to be located closer to your customers. This can also be important if your line of business must comply with industry and government regulations that require your applications and data to be located within a certain geographic location.</p>
<p>For the projects in this book, we do not have either of these concerns. Therefore, for consistency, let's pick the <strong>US East (N. Virginia)</strong> region again.</p>
<p>Here's what your <strong>S3 buckets</strong> page might look like after creation, but of course, with different bucket names:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fac9be43-0b74-4f77-90f2-31a75847bc46.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Once you have created the S3 buckets, go ahead and click on the <strong>contents.aws.ai</strong> bucket. You will see a screen similar to this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/86da17a9-c216-45c0-bc7b-4d88376a0fe3.png" style=""/></div>
<p>On this screen, you will be able to upload files to the bucket, configure bucket properties, set access permissions, and perform advanced settings such as life cycle rules and cross-region replication. We will come back to some of these settings later on, but for now, upload one or more photos that you want to analyze with the Rekognition service. You can click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button or simply drag and drop the photos to this page to upload them. We can leave all the file settings as default for now.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you just stored some files in the AWS cloud platform with 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability! In other words, if you store 10,000 files in S3, statistically, you would lose one file every 10 million years, and all of the files are available for your application to access 525,547.4 minutes out of 525,600 minutes every year.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Identity and Access Management</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The next AWS service we will be looking at is the <strong>Identity and Access Management</strong> or <strong>IAM</strong>. IAM allows you to manage access to other AWS services and resources securely. AWS offers enterprise-grade security and access control, which is great for building production-ready applications in the cloud. However, if you are new to AWS, working around IAM can be challenging at first. If the necessary access was not granted, the services will simply refuse to perform the desired <span>actions</span>. We will be working with IAM quite a lot to build the projects in this book. You will get familiar with concepts such as users, groups, and roles so that you can provide your applications with the necessary access to the required services.</p>
<p>Let's go to the IAM home page by clicking on <strong>IAM</strong> from the list of services under <strong>Security, Identity, and Compliance</strong> in order to navigate to its home page. The IAM home page should look similar to this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2cd3c0bc-d0ca-433c-97e5-fdf4767f07f5.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The IAM dashboard gives you an overview of the IAM resources and their security status. So far, we don't have any users or groups, but AWS has created two roles by default.</p>
<p>We have been accessing the AWS Management Console using our root account. This account, by default, can only access the AWS Management Console; it will not be able to interact with AWS services programmatically. Let's create a new user with programmatic access for the hands-on projects.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Users</strong> on the left-hand pane, and then click on the <strong>Add user</strong> button:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/72e23788-836c-45f7-9bdd-47729651fca9.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After entering the desired username, be sure to select only <strong>Programmatic access</strong>. Programmatic access will enable an access key ID and a secret access key pair. This key pair can be used by AWS APIs, the CLI, and the SDK. It is good practice to limit each user to either programmatic access or AWS Management Console access.</p>
<p>Here, we created an <kbd>aws_ai</kbd> user with only programmatic access:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/00d5aee4-ff85-4449-a129-8cc2f296223e.png" style=""/></div>
<p>On the next screen, let's also create a group to manage the permissions. We recommend adding users to one or more groups with the necessary permissions, rather than attaching the individual permissions and policies to the users directly. This way, it's much easier to manage the permissions when there are numerous users that require different permissions in your organization.</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Create group</strong> button under <strong>Add user to group</strong>, as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fcc40ac8-c777-4c6f-a92b-39b206e22457.png" style=""/></div>
<p>For our group, let's name it <kbd>Developer</kbd>, and then attach the <strong>AdministratorAccess</strong> policy to this group:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1742 image-border" src="assets/264ded77-6d3d-4e62-b7bd-4adf8664490b.png" style=""/></div>
<p>We do not need to create any tags, so just review and create the user.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For simplicity, we are attaching a very powerful policy with full access to AWS services. For your production environment, you will want to be more fine-grained with your permissions and policies. You always want to follow the principle of least privilege when it comes to system security.</div>
<p>Once the user has been created, you will see the <strong>Success</strong> screen:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/db900fb7-a575-4434-81c9-eefb203dab1c.png" style=""/></div>
<p>On this screen, you have the option to view or download the access key pair that we mentioned earlier. This is the only time that the secret access key can be displayed or downloaded, so go ahead and download the CSV file onto your computer. We will need this key pair when we use the AWS CLI and the AWS SDK later in this chapter.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The access key pair is equivalent to your username and password combination. It is vital that you do not share your key pairs with others, as it will give other access to your AWS resources, but leaving you to foot the bill. Also, never hardcode the key pairs in the source code and then check them into a public source code repository. There are automated bots out there that scan the code repositories for AWS key pairs in order to steal resources to perform hacking or cryptocurrency mining activities.</div>
<p>Congratulations, you just used the IAM service to create a user and added it to a group with administrative permissions! If you go back to the dashboard, you will see that we have added it to the IAM resources and made progress regarding the security status:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/80055712-0d67-4b45-948d-e61aec720884.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">We highly recommend that you complete the remaining two steps in the security status section. The first remaining step is to activate <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>) on your root account. Activating MFA will add extra security on your root account by requiring anyone to log in with both the root account password (something you know) and a one-time token from an authentication device (something you have), for example, your smartphone. The second remaining step is to set up a IAM password policy to ensure that secure password practices are followed. You can define the password's length, complexity, expiration period, and more.</div>

<p>The AWS CLI is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services by issuing commands from your Terminal shell. Earlier in this chapter, we interacted with a few AWS services through the web-based AWS Management Console. While the web console is the easiest interface for new users to get familiar with AWS, it can be cumbersome to use during the software development process. With the AWS CLI tool, you get all of the same functionalities as the web console but at your fingertips in the Terminal shell, where most of your development tools reside. This way, your development process is more fluid without the context switching to and from the browser.</p>
<p>The AWS CLI is primarily distributed via the Python package manager; therefore, you need to install Python on your development machine first. Note that we will be using Python for the development of the projects as well. It is important that you install Python by following the instructions in order to ensure the compatibility of your development environment later.</p>

<p>While Python is pre-installed on macOS, that version of Python is 2.7. To install a newer version of Python, we recommend using a package manager for macOS called Homebrew. Homebrew is touted as the missing package manager for macOS; it simplifies the installation of many macOS software packages, including Python. To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on its website: <a href="https://brew.sh">https://brew.sh</a>. At the time of writing, the command to install Homebrew in the Terminal is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong><span class="s1">$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</span></strong></pre>
<p>Once Homebrew has been installed, we can install the latest Python and pip, the Python package management system, with the following commands in the Terminal prompt:</p>
<pre><strong>$ brew install python3</strong><br/><strong>$ brew install pip3</strong></pre>
<p>Check whether the latest Python and pip version have been correctly linked on your system with the commands in the Terminal prompt:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python --version</strong><br/><strong>$ pip --version</strong></pre>
<p>The outputs of these commands should state versions similar to 3.7+ and 18.0+, respectively.</p>

<p>There are many different distributions of Linux available. The instructions to install Python might be different, depending on your specific Linux distribution. In general, you should first check to see if Python is already installed on your system in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python --version</strong><br/><strong>$ pip --version</strong></pre>
<p>If Python or pip is not installed, or a different version is installed, install them with your Linux distribution's package manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu, use <kbd>apt</kbd>:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip</strong></pre>
<ul>
<li>For Red Hat derivatives such as Fedora, use <kbd>yum</kbd>:</li>

<p>If you are running Windows 10, we highly recommend that you install the <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> or <strong>WSL</strong>. WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution of your choice on the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>First, you need to enable the WSL, which is an optional feature within Windows 10. To do this, open PowerShell as the administrator and run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux</strong></pre>
<p>Restart your computer if prompted.</p>
<p>Next, you can download and install your preferred Linux distribution from the Windows Store. At the time of writing, there are five Linux distributions available for the WSL: Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Debian GNU/Linux, and Kali Linux.</p>
<p>Once your preferred Linux distribution has been installed, you can then follow the Python installation instructions for that particular Linux distribution.</p>

<p>Once Python has been successfully installed on your development machine, we can move on to installing the AWS CLI. The AWS CLI is primarily distributed via the Python package manager, <kbd>pip</kbd>, which we just installed. You can install and verify the AWS CLI with the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>$ pip install awscli</strong><br/><strong>$ aws --version</strong></pre>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Before we can use the AWS CLI, we need to perform a few configuration steps. The fastest way to configure your AWS CLI is with the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws configure</strong><br/><strong>AWS Access Key ID [None]: &lt;your access key&gt;</strong><br/><strong>AWS Secret Access Key [None]: &lt;your secret key&gt;</strong><br/><strong>Default region name [None]: us-east-1</strong><br/><strong>Default output format [None]: json</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root">The explanation of the preceding code is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two items that we need to enter are the security credentials so that the CLI has the permissions to perform actions on your behalf. This is the key pair that is contained within the CSV file that we downloaded during the creation of a new user with the IAM service. Open the CSV file and copy and paste the access key ID and the secret access key into the configuration command prompt.</li>
<li>Next, for the default region name, we will again use <kbd>us-east-1</kbd> for consistency throughout this book.</li>
<li>Finally, for the default output format, enter <kbd>json</kbd>. This will set the output for the AWS CLI to be JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AWS configure command creates a hidden directory, <kbd>.aws</kbd>, in your user home directory, for example, <kbd>~/.aws</kbd> on macOS and Linux. In this directory, two files are created. One is <kbd>.aws/credentials</kbd>, with the following code: </p>
<pre>[default]<br/>aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY<br/>aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY</pre>
<p>The other is <kbd>.aws/config</kbd>, with the following code:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>region = us-east-1<br/>output = json</pre>
<p>Locate these files on your system and verify their contents.</p>
<p>In case you did not copy down or download the access key pair, you can obtain a new key pair in the AWS Management Console:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> service under the <strong>Security, Identity, &amp; Compliance</strong> heading.</li>
<li>In the <strong>IAM</strong> <strong>Management Console</strong>, click on <strong>Users</strong> on the right-hand pane and click on your username.</li>
<li>On the user summary page, click on the <strong>Security credentials </strong>tab.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Access keys</strong> section, click on the <strong>Create access key</strong> button and a new access key will be created for you.</li>
<li>Remember to delete the old key pair after the new one has been created.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how your screen will look:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1680bf73-ce4f-45f4-b5c5-65e48b201e49.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Remember to configure your AWS CLI <span>with the following command,</span> each time you change your access key:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws configure</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root">Enter your <span>security credentials, default region, and default output format as we explained in the initial AWS CLI configuration.</span></p>
<p>To test whether the AWS CLI is configured properly, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws s3 ls</strong><br/><strong>2018-12-01 18:01:20 contents.aws.ai</strong><br/><strong>2018-12-01 18:01:49 data.aws.ai</strong><br/><strong>2018-12-01 18:01:35 website.aws.ai</strong></pre>
<p>This command will print all of the S3 buckets in your AWS account. More specifically, this command lists the S3 buckets that the user who is associated with the access key has permissions to see. Remember the key pair we configured the CLI with, which belongs to the user to whom we granted the administrative policy? One of the permissions within the administrative policy gives the user access to S3. In any case, you should see the S3 bucket that we created in the previous section of this chapter via the AWS Management Console.</p>

<p>Now, let's invoke the object detection capability of Amazon Rekognition via the AWS CLI. This time, let's perform the object detection on an image that's stored in one of our S3 buckets. We will be using a sample image from Pexels, a website with thousands of royalty-free images. Download the image at <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/animal-beagle-canine-close-up-460823/">https://www.pexels.com/photo/animal-beagle-canine-close-up-460823/</a> and upload it to the <kbd>contents</kbd> S3 bucket.</p>
<p>Here, we can see an adorable beagle puppy laying on what appears to be a bed of gravel: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/235579bd-0020-4644-8790-73b395c793b1.png" style=""/></div>
<p>You should see the following output when you list the objects in your <kbd>contents</kbd> bucket:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws s3 ls s3://&lt;YOUR BUCKET&gt;</strong><br/><strong>2018-12-02 13:31:32     362844 animal-beagle-canine-460823.jpg</strong></pre>
<p>Now that we have an image, we can invoke the object detection capability of Rekognition via the following CLI command. Note that we must escape the <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd> characters with a <kbd>\</kbd>, and we must not include any spaces when specifying the S3 object on the command line:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws rekognition detect-labels --image S3Object=\{Bucket=&lt;YOUR BUCKET&gt;,Name=animal-beagle-canine-460823.jpg\}</strong></pre>
<p>The results come back almost instantly:</p>
<pre><strong>{</strong><br/><strong> "Labels": [</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Mammal",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Pet",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Hound",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Dog",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Canine",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Animal",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.9777603149414</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Beagle",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 98.0347900390625</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Road",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 82.47952270507812</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Gravel",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 74.52912902832031</strong><br/><strong> },</strong><br/><strong> {</strong><br/><strong> "Name": "Dirt Road",</strong><br/><strong> "Confidence": 74.52912902832031</strong><br/><strong> }</strong><br/><strong> ]</strong><br/><strong>}</strong></pre>
<p>The output is in JSON format, just like we configured the CLI to the output. From the output, the Rekognition service detected several objects or labels. Rekognition is very sure that it detected a dog; it even identified the breed of the dog as a beagle! Rekognition also detected the gravel in the image, which could be a part of a dirt road. The AWS CLI can be very useful when trying out an AWS service, and to see how the output is structured when we are developing our applications.</p>

<p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Thanks to its popularity with the data science and ML community, Python is also one of the fastest-growing programming languages. There is a large number of add-on libraries from its developers and the open source community. These libraries enable Python developers to do almost anything, from data analytics to deep neural networks, from simple scripting to web application development.</p>
<p>For AI and ML, Python is the de facto language. There's the popular scikit-learn library that gives developers access to many useful ML algorithms. There are also many libraries for deep neural networks, such as MXNet and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>We will be using Python for every hands-on projects throughout this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first half of this book, we will create intelligent-enabled solutions using AWS AI services. For these projects, we will use Python to create the backend components, APIs, and web applications that will bring our intelligent creations to life. AWS offers a Python SDK called Boto. With Boto, we can interact with all of the AWS services from our applications, including the managed AI capabilities.</li>
<li>In the second half of this book, we will be training custom ML models using AWS ML services. For these projects, we will use Python to process data, train ML models, and deploy intelligent capabilities. In addition to the Boto SDK, we will also use AWS libraries for SageMaker, <strong>Elastic MapReduce</strong> (<strong>EMR</strong>), and many more.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>Let's start by setting up our local development environment. Since we are building end-to-end solutions in the projects, there are numerous packages and dependencies that we will need. The packages we will need don't always come as part of the standard library. Our projects will sometimes need specific versions of the libraries to get all of the moving pieces working together. Therefore, it is very important that you follow these instructions to install the packages, as described in this chapter.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We will use a Python virtual environment to manage the packages for the projects in this book. A virtual environment is a Pythonic way to create a self-contained project directory tree that includes a particular combination of a Python version and packages that are specific to a project.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of using Python virtual environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since all of the packages and dependencies of a project are specified in a configuration file, the project's development environment can be easily duplicated by other developers; this is very useful when you are working within a development team.</li>
<li>Even if you are working by yourself, having a virtual environment will help you with creating (and recreating) the environment on one or more computers for development, testing, and deployment.</li>
<li>A virtual environment also allows you to create separate Python environments, where parallel copies of Python dependencies can be installed. This way, we can keep conflicting Python versions and packages for different projects on the same computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pipenv is the new kid on the block when it comes to Python virtual environments, but it has already been promoted as the officially recommended Python packaging tool from <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>. <span>To install <kbd>pipenv</kbd>, we will use Pip, the Python package management tool:</span></p>
<pre><strong>$ pip install pipenv</strong><br/><strong>$ pipenv --version</strong></pre>
<p><span>This command will help you install and verify <kbd>pipenv</kbd>.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>Now that we have installed the Python toolset, let's take it for a test drive by creating a Python project that can interact with the AWS cloud platform. First, let's create a directory for the project and name it <kbd>ObjectDetectionDemo</kbd>. Within this directory, we initialize a Python 3 virtual environment with <kbd>pipenv</kbd>, as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir <span>ObjectDetectionDemo</span></strong><br/><strong>$ cd <span>ObjectDetectionDemo</span></strong><br/><strong>$ pipenv --three</strong></pre>
<p>After these commands, the <kbd><span>ObjectDetectionDemo</span></kbd> directory will contain a <kbd>Pipfile</kbd>. The <kbd>Pipfile</kbd> is a <kbd>pipenv</kbd> configuration file that specifies this project's Python packages and their dependencies.</p>
<p>Next, we specify and install the AWS Python SDK, Boto, for the <kbd><span>ObjectDetectionDemo</span></kbd> project:</p>
<pre><strong>$ pipenv install boto3</strong></pre>
<p>It might take a few minutes for Pipenv to synchronize with the Python package index and to install the <kbd>boto3</kbd> package, along with its dependencies. After the installation, your Pipefile should have the following contents:</p>
<pre>[[source]]<br/>url = "https://pypi.org/simple"<br/>verify_ssl = true<br/>name = "pypi"<br/><br/>[packages]<br/>"boto3" = "*"<br/><br/>[requires]<br/>python_version = "3.7"</pre>
<p>As you can see here, <kbd>boto3</kbd> has an entry under the packages section. Currently, the version number is listed as <kbd>*</kbd>, which means, use the latest version. You can replace <kbd>*</kbd> with a specific version for any of the packages for your project if necessary.</p>

<p>Now, let's write our first Python application that will detect the objects in the images that are stored in an S3 bucket. To do this, we will leverage <kbd>boto3</kbd> to interact with both the Amazon S3 service and the Amazon Rekognition service:</p>
<div class="packt_tip">You can use any text editor, or your favorite Python <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>), to create the Python source files.

If you are running the script on your local development machine, then the AWS access key pair is taken from the <kbd>~/.aws/credentials</kbd> file. We will cover how the credentials are used in other runtime environments in later chapters.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For simplicity, we kept the project code relatively short and simple. We will enhance these Python classes in later hands-on projects.<br/>
Even though this is only a demo project, it is still good practice to organize the code into different components with separation of concerns. In this project, all of the business logic that will interact with the Amazon S3 service are encapsulated within the <kbd>StorageService</kbd> class; the same is done for all the logic that will interact with the Amazon Rekognition service in the <kbd>RecogntionService</kbd> class.

<p>Congratulations, you just created your first intelligent-enabled application that leverages the power of AI to perform image analysis on the AWS platform! Sit back and think about it; with just a few lines of code, you were able to create a piece of software that can detect and identify countless numbers of objects in our world. This is the quick lift you can get when leveraging AWS AI services.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned that AI has existed for a long time, but it is becoming popular again due to the renewed interested in ML, more specifically, with a<span>rtificial neural networks. We looked at a few real-world applications of AI and ML. We got an overview of the two groups of AI offerings from AWS; the AWS AI services that give you a quick lift when developing intelligent-enabled applications, and the AWS ML platforms that allow you to build custom AI capabilities that are tailored to your application. We recommended that you try to leverage the provided AWS AI services first, and only develop custom AI capabilities if you have a specialized need and you have a data-competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p>We got familiar with several services on AWS through hands-on experience, including the AI services and the other complimentary cloud services. We also set up our local development environment for AI applications, including Python, the AWS CLI, and Python virtual environments. We then created our first intelligent-enabled application using the Amazon S3 and Amazon Rekognition services.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will dive into the components and the architecture of AI applications. We will set up an architecture template for many of the upcoming hands-on projects, and more importantly, we will cover the design principles and decisions that this architecture template is based on.</p>
