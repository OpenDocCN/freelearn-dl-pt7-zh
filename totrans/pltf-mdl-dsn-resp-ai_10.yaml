    and the best practices for governance in organizations to reduce costs and increase
    efficiency. The primary objective of this chapter is to demonstrate MRM techniques
    by ensuring adherence to the right model metrics, along with using tools from
    both the model and data perspectives that can enable us to nurture the right risk
    mitigation and governance practices. You’ll learn how designing and formulating
    risk management scorecards can help prevent businesses from losing additional
    money.

    running multiple experiments can be better managed and shared among teams collaboratively.

    the financial industry. This has enabled additional controls to be applied for
    MRM by banks and insurers. However, this can be extended and applied to other

    adopted continuous monitoring and model retraining pipelines as a result of the
    huge volume of transactions happening every day. Although we will examine a real-world

    that model risk should be identified, mapped, tested, and reviewed so that institutions
    can quantify the market risk to capital. It also provides the flexibility of allocating

  zh: MRM 的成本节约
- en: MRM primarily aims to reduce costs and prevent losses by increasing operational
    and process efficiency in building, validating, and deploying models, where ineffective
    models are eliminated. In addition to cost reduction comes capital improvement
    because of the reduction in undue capital buffers and add-ons. A well-defined
    MRM function often gives regulators confidence and reduces penalties, also avoiding
    expenditure on the costs of noncompliance. MRM clearly produces a tangible improvement
    in **Profit and Loss** (**P&L**), as modeling costs are reduced (in the order
    of millions) when fragmented model ownership is addressed. Complex models are
    replaced and more interpretable versions are added and assigned to the right business
    units. Research results reveal a global bank spent an additional *€44 million*,
    up from *€7 million* (yielding a total of *€51 million*) in *four years*, showing
    a nearly sevenfold increase in the capital budget spent on models. Thanks to the
    MRM framework, banks gain confidence in the existing model landscape, which helps
    them to align investing in models with business risks and their priorities and
    reduce P&L volatility. This not only places the focus on the transparency of models
    but also gives them a way to nurture an institutional risk culture. Then, cost
    savings free up resources and funds that can be allocated to high-priority decision-making
    models.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: MRM的主要目标是通过提高构建、验证和部署模型的操作和流程效率来降低成本并防止损失，其中无效的模型将被淘汰。除了成本降低之外，由于减少了不必要的资本缓冲和附加费用，还带来了资本改善。一个定义明确的MRM职能通常能增强监管者的信心，减少罚款，并避免不合规带来的支出。MRM显著改善了**盈亏**（**P&L**），因为当解决了模型所有权分散的问题时，建模成本（以百万计）将大幅降低。复杂模型被替换，并增加了更具可解释性的版本，并将其分配给合适的业务单元。研究结果表明，一家全球银行在*四年*内额外花费了*4400万欧元*，相比原本的*700万欧元*（总计*5100万欧元*），这显示出在模型上的资本预算花费几乎增长了七倍。得益于MRM框架，银行在现有模型环境中获得了信心，这有助于他们将模型投资与业务风险及其优先事项对齐，并减少盈亏波动。这不仅将重点放在模型的透明度上，还为他们提供了培养机构风险文化的方法。接着，成本节省释放了可以分配给高优先级决策模型的资源和资金。
- en: The advantage of a defined and structured approach to MRM is that it reduces
    ML development costs by *20-30%*. This has made banks increasingly cautious about
    the risks arising from improper model use and has instead caused them to concentrate
    on their model validation budget to optimize the model inventory with higher quality,
    consistency, and resilience. Another important factor that has been increasingly
    taken into account is risk identification based on the priority of business decisions.
    Here, we can see the emergence of the concept of model risk classification techniques
    (also known as tiers), which can further boost speed and efficiency by strategizing
    the use of resources and establishing strong governance.

- en: Model risk tiering, expressed in absolute terms, is an abstract external demonstration
    of model inventory risks that identifies and differentiates the risks presented
    by one model’s use compared with the risks presented by other models. The assessment
    metric is an important parameter for consideration in businesses (especially in
    banks) that determines and contrasts the model risks for a single business use
    case and reflects the seriousness of any problems. This is directly dependent
    on how we evaluate the model inventory and define the risk classification factors.
    It is closely associated with other external and internal factors of the business,
    market conditions, and other financial risk factors that sort the models based
    on their increasing order of importance.

- en: At the first level of the tree, the dimension assesses whether the model quantifies
    risk, delays, timing, prices, or any other value – an indicator specifying the
    overall risk of the model’s domain coverage. This paves the way for further classification
    categories. The answer “*no*” leads to the conclusion that the model belongs to
    a low-risk tier, whereas an answer of “*yes*” compels movement to the next stage.
    The next evaluation metric tries to ascertain the model use dimension to determine
    the use of the model either in critical decision-making or regulatory or financial
    reporting. If the answer is “*yes*,” the model is marked as belonging to a high-risk
    or moderate-risk tier, whereas “*no*” culminates in marking the model as in the
    low-risk to moderate-risk tiers. If a model falls in the moderate- to high-risk
    tier, it is tested against the level of exposure relative to a threshold. If the
    exposure level is high, the regulatory or financial decision-making models are
    classified as high risk, whereas the same category of models with limited exposure
    is marked as moderate risk. Models not involved in critical decision-making processes
    are again tested against the level of exposure and classified as either low risk
    or moderate risk. This kind of MRT relies solely on judgmental inputs with binary
    categorical outcomes; there is no room to accommodate more than two answers to
    any question.

    One way to calibrate it is to maintain the pre-existing relative ranking of models
    to minimize the change to model risk assignments. When changes in risk tiers are
    systematically controlled, this reduces additional work and enables the use of
    pre-existing risk-related information in the process. Calibration often comes
    about as a result of exhaustive trial and error, iterative adjustments to model
    profile elements, and judgmental processes to compare, contrast, and evaluate

    summary of the model inventory, where missing models are placed in lower-risk
    tiers; tier-specific MRM requirements that help to align the models; and the proportion
    of the inventory that should be classified as high risk due to supervisory pressure
    or being subjected to stress testing. After a review with business and model owners,
    organizations still may need to set overrides so that the MRS assigns models to

    native client learning environments (currently `spark.ml1` and `scikit-learn2`),
    a storage layer optimized to store models, and a web-based visual interface to
    run meta-analysis across models. It can record multi-stage pipelines involving
    preprocessing, training, and testing steps by managing information related to
    metadata (such as the parameters of preprocessing steps and model hyperparameters),
    quality metrics (such as the AUC and accuracy), and even the training and test

- en: Organizations driven by data, and even legacy organizations, have become aware
    of the role and importance of **feature stores** in deriving real-time insights.
    These insights are valuable for any industry domain, as they convey meaningful
    information about the customer metrics that drive business. These insights are
    possible due to rapid development and the use of predictive microservices, which
    can process data both in batches and in real time. The primary purpose of scalable
    feature stores in the cloud is to save effort and time by bringing business stakeholders,
    architects, data scientists, big data professionals, and analytics professionals
    under one umbrella through one unified foundation block. It facilitates collaboration
    through the sharing of data, models, features, results, and reports. This unified
    foundation block, called a feature store, can enhance the model deployment life
    cycle across teams by allowing the reuse of information to create structured documents,
    do the required version analysis, and evaluate model performance.
