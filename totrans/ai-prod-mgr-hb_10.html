			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Benchmarking Performance, Growth Hacking, and Cost</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will understand the benchmarking needed to gauge product success in all its various forms. Rather than exploring the performance of the models, we will be looking at performance from a product and growth perspective, including <strong class="bold">value metrics</strong>, <strong class="bold">north star metrics</strong>, <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>), and <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>) that companies can use to get early signals on whether their product strategy is successful and will lead to growth hacking. We will also be discussing how companies can prepare themselves to defend their product when it’s compared to <span class="No-Break">other products.</span></p>
			<p>Before we get into the particulars of benchmarking performance, pricing, and growth hacking, let’s set the stage a bit. All these aspects are tools that we use to decipher whether things are going well or not. However, by far the greatest marker of whether your product is a good choice for the customers you’re looking to serve or not is to demonstrate that it works first and that the type of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) you deployed in your product was the best choice for <span class="No-Break">the job.</span></p>
			<p>When it comes to the success of your product, it will all come down to how effectively you can communicate its value to your potential customers and put it to the test. Part of maneuvering between your sales teams and customer conversations will involve making sure the tangible benefit your AI product can bring to your customers is a big part of the <span class="No-Break">sales process.</span></p>
			<p>When customers come to you and give you the stage, do you have a dependable demo to show them? Are you able to show them your product’s performance across a variety of datasets or does it only work well when you use your own data? Can you talk about the approach or algorithm you’re using without having to resort to the safe space of a <em class="italic">proprietary blend</em> that you’re not at liberty to discuss? Can you confidently get them in touch with partners or customers they can speak with to get a referral? Before you start to track the performance of your product for your sales or investment pitch, you will need to build trust within the ecosystem you’re a part of. Communicating success when there isn’t a foundation of strength will <span class="No-Break">ring hollow.</span></p>
			<p>As we continue with the chapter and discuss how we can gauge and communicate a product’s success, as well as how we can determine an appropriate cost structure, we have to remember one foundational truth: at the end of the day, cost doesn’t matter. Sure, it’s important to remain in a palatable realm, and some of your customers will be more cost-conscious than others, but at the end of the day, customers don’t forgo powerful products because of the price tag. If it works and it works better than the other products out there, they will find a way to make <span class="No-Break">the budget.</span></p>
			<p>Buying software is tricky. Amid the <strong class="bold">proofs of concept</strong>, the budgetary discussions, the countless meetings with every company you’re considering, the time and dedication of your own technical resources to work with every potential tool and see how it would work in your environment, the feature comparisons, managing internal stakeholders, and, finally, getting alignment on one product that the company feels is best for their use case, the entire process can be exhausting and frustrating. This offers product managers a huge opportunity to make their customers’ lives much easier while making their products stand out from <span class="No-Break">the rest.</span></p>
			<p>With that, let’s dive into the chapter. We will be covering the following <span class="No-Break">topics here:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Value metrics – a guide to north star metrics, KPIs, <span class="No-Break">and OKRs</span></li>
				<li>Hacking – <span class="No-Break">product-led growth</span></li>
				<li>The tech stack – <span class="No-Break">early signals</span></li>
				<li>Managing costs and pricing – AI <span class="No-Break">is expensive</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Value metrics – a guide to north star metrics, KPIs and OKRs</h1>
			<p>All relationships<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> are built on trust, and this includes the relationships that companies/product managers have with their customers and the market. Assuming you’ve found a way to build a reputable circle of trust around your product, it’s now your job as product manager to make sure this relationship continues to grow and evolve, ideally by incorporating feedback from your market. A great way to do this is by communicating the value of your product and continuously building and referencing that growth and evolution. The way to do so is by using tools to track and confirm your product’s progress. The key question is: what will you choose to track and which metrics will you give particular attention to? This is something that all companies struggle with getting right because it can be tempting to tie all pursuits to revenue and make that the top value metric, but that often doesn’t give us a <span class="No-Break">full picture.</span></p>
			<p>We briefly touched on concepts of how to measure and communicate success metrics in <a href="B18935_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor246"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, but in this section, we will be expanding on value metrics, KPIs, and OKRs further through the lens of what’s best kept inside the business and what’s best communicated outward. Choosing metrics, particularly a north star metric, is a rigorous and meticulous activity, and it’s best done in a collaborative environment. You want to have a diversity of voices present when you’re making such foundational decisions. These are decisions that shouldn’t be taken lightly because, in many ways, the establishment of these norms will have downstream ripple effects that touch virtually all your internal teams in one way <span class="No-Break">or another.</span></p>
			<p>Many of the KPIs we went over in <a href="B18935_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor246"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a> related to evaluating your products’ AI/ML benchmarks, but in this chapter, the KPIs we will focus on will mostly relate to your general product’s KPIs and how that relates to your overall product strategy. Your product strategy is an extension of your product vision, establishing KPIs and metrics that reflect not just what your product’s goals are for its users but also what its users find most valuable <span class="No-Break">about it.</span></p>
			<p>Finding a way to articulate this value <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>and communicating it continuously in both internal and external contexts is perhaps the most important aspect when it comes to engaging your market because it influences how you see and hear your customers and, ultimately, how you speak to them. Let’s <span class="No-Break">dive in<a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>North star metrics</h2>
			<p>Choosing your product’s north<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> star metric is an important part of aligning<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> your product strategy with the realization of a key goal. It’s common for most products to be oriented toward one top metric that the company is using to track progress. Choosing the wrong one, or not choosing one at all, can have discombobulating influences on how your teams are built, guided, and measured. It can also have the unfortunate unintended consequence of not giving you a full picture of what’s happening on the customer side. This is particularly important with regard to the nascent AI/ML-native product because you want to make sure you’re getting an early signal on what’s working and what isn’t so that you can improve your <span class="No-Break">product sooner.</span></p>
			<p>This can also have a disruptive effect on how you choose to measure the success of your product overall. This is because the north star metric serves as your primary KPI. It doesn’t just unite your entire company around a common goal but it also communicates how well the company as a whole is performing. Using it tells folks internally and externally whether things are going well overall (or not). If you’re doing it right, you will have one metric to serve as an elegant indicator of revenue, performance, and engagement. The benefits of doing this <span class="No-Break">are threefold.</span></p>
			<p>You’re not just giving<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> your organization as a whole alignment with your product<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> team but you’re also giving your product team a standard to stay accountable to and be measured against. These two systems working together create a feedback loop so that anyone at your organization can see, with a large degree of certainty, whether the ship is sailing the way it should be. This informs discussions that marketing, sales, logistics, finance, product, and customer success teams all have with each other, as well as within their own teams. If you’re a product manager, particularly one pioneering a novel AI product, we highly suggest you push for the establishment of a north <span class="No-Break">star metric.</span></p>
			<p>It might be tempting to take a <em class="italic">laissez-faire</em> approach. After all, a product has traditionally and often<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> been measured on how much is built and shipped. However, establishing a north star metric is a strategic choice that benefits the product’s function and influence within the company. This is especially true for AI companies because of the novelty of AI and the strategic importance it has on the market today. Establishing a north star metric is a way of demonstrating to the entire organization that the product team is foundationally aligned with the success of the business and it reinforces the idea that the company is product-led and <span class="No-Break">not sales-led.</span></p>
			<p>Chances are, if you’re foundationally involved with building your product strategy and creating a product vision, you have some clarity already on what your north star metric will be because it aligns most closely<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> with the ultimate value of your product. We suggest Growth Academy (<a href="https://www.growth-academy.com/north-star-metric-checklist-and-common-pitfalls">https://www.growth-academy.com/north-star-metric-checklist-and-common-pitfalls</a>) as a resource if you’d like more direction on how to establish a north star metric, but for now, here are some questions to get <span class="No-Break">you going:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What does my product intend <span class="No-Break">to do?</span></li>
				<li>How do I know whether it carries out its <span class="No-Break">intended function?</span></li>
				<li>Which activities result in the best experience with <span class="No-Break">my product?</span></li>
				<li>What do my customers value most about <span class="No-Break">my product?</span></li>
				<li>Is there a moment in my customer’s journey that <span class="No-Break">hooks them?</span></li>
				<li>What are some indicators of future revenue other than <em class="italic">sign-ups</em> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">purchases</em></span><span class="No-Break">?</span></li>
				<li>Is my goal to make customers more productive, capture their attention, or get them to <span class="No-Break">buy something?</span></li>
				<li>Do I want my customers to make specific actions or a wide variety <span class="No-Break">of actions?</span></li>
				<li>Is success measured by how often or how efficiently my customers rely on <span class="No-Break">my product?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every company will have a different methodology<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> for arriving at a north star metric because<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> it’s so foundationally centered around the business model, which is why establishing a north star metric is part of your overall product strategy discussions. It will also be based on your ideal customer journey because you’re optimizing for a certain moment that most benefits your customer’s expectations and aligns that moment with what’s most important to the <span class="No-Break">company’s success.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You may want to have more than one north star metric if your business model and success make more sense with a <span class="No-Break">multifaceted approach.</span></p>
			<p>The following is a list of famous digital product companies<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> and their north <span class="No-Break">star metric(s):</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Airbnb</em> focuses on quantity using <span class="No-Break">nights booked.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Uber</em>’s ultimate goal is to boost ridership, so they focus on <span class="No-Break">rides booked.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">HubSpot</em> looks for entire teams to be actively engaged on their platform to ensure their software is depended on regularly, so they use weekly <span class="No-Break">active teams.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Amazon</em> doesn’t just look for total sales – they look for a pattern of behavior for all their users, so they use monthly purchases <span class="No-Break">per user.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">LinkedIn</em> might not be a social media tool you’ll use daily, but if you’re a working professional, you’ll likely have a reason to come back on a monthly basis, so they focus on monthly <span class="No-Break">active users.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">BlueApron</em> is one of the few that have two north star metrics, so they focus on orders per customer as well <span class="No-Break">as revenue.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Facebook</em> and <em class="italic">Instagram</em> want to create a daily dependency on your attention, so they focus on daily <span class="No-Break">active users.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Netflix</em> ultimately tries to encourage people to view all their films and shows and they keep it simple by focusing on <span class="No-Break">watch time.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Spotify</em> also has two north star metrics, conveying a focus on returning users with monthly active users, as well as the consumption of music on their platform with <span class="No-Break">stream time.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Duolingo</em> has three north star metrics – daily active users, learn time, and success – reinforcing their desire for active learners to come back frequently and spend a significant amount of time learning and seeing the positive results of <span class="No-Break">that dedication.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Quora</em> keeps it simple by focusing<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> on the number of <span class="No-Break">questions answered</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are also a number<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> of out-of-the-box north star metrics categories you can contemplate<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> as you’re sifting through your options, particularly if you’re getting started with a novel product in your product suite or if you’re just building a company. Again, be incredibly discerning about these metrics and put them to the test. Brainstorm with your go-to-market/sales/leadership team and workshop them. Try to arrive at a full destination assuming these metrics are in place. Ask yourself: what does our business look like a year, 5 years, or 10 years down the line if we make this our <span class="No-Break">north star?</span></p>
			<p>The following is a list of many common KPIs and metrics you can cover, along <span class="No-Break">with descriptions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Annual/monthly recurring revenue</strong>: A measure of predictable revenues across a month <span class="No-Break">or year</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Revenue growth</strong>: The percentage of revenue growth compared to the <span class="No-Break">previous period</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Paid users</strong>: The number of all <span class="No-Break">active subscribers/purchasers</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The average revenue per user</strong>: All revenue divided by the number of <span class="No-Break">total users</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer lifetime value</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLTV</strong>): The revenue generated by each <span class="No-Break">customer acquired</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer acquisition costs</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAC</strong>): The total costs associated with marketing, sales, and advertising<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> for each <span class="No-Break">customer</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker490"/></span><span class="No-Break"> acquired</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Profit margin</strong>: The percentage (ratio) of revenue compared <span class="No-Break">to costs</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Marketshare</strong>: The percentage (ratio) of your company’s total revenue compared to your industry’s <span class="No-Break">total revenue</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monthly/daily active users</strong>: The number of all active subscribers/purchasers over a period <span class="No-Break">of time</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Net promoter score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>): A metric of <span class="No-Break">customer loyalty</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer satisfaction</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSAT</strong>): Measures <span class="No-Break">customer sentiment</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer retention rate</strong>: The percentage of customers that stay with you over a period <span class="No-Break">of time</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Churn rate</strong>: The percentage of customers that stop buying from you or using your service over a period <span class="No-Break">of time</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Messages sent/nights booked/rides booked</strong>: You can insert any applicable action here, but this would be one particular action you’re using as a marker for success, such as nights booked or <span class="No-Break">rides booked</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sessions per user</strong>: The number of times a user opens <span class="No-Break">your product/app</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Session duration</strong>: How long each user spends using <span class="No-Break">your product/app</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User actions per session</strong>: How active users are when they are <span class="No-Break">in session</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Average support resolution time</strong>: How long your customers wait to get support<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> when they have issues<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> wit<a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>h<a id="_idTextAnchor332"/> <span class="No-Break">your product/app</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>KPIs and other metrics</h2>
			<p>The previous section<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> on north star metrics already gave us some good examples<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> of the variety of metrics we can track. This is an excellent way of grouping various KPIs you’re going to track, besides whichever you settle on for your north star metric, because the goal of metrics is to give us quick flashes of insight into the strength and success of your product. However, these numbers don’t stand alone. What good is it if your revenue is great but it’s only coming from two customers? What good is it if your customers install your product but never use <span class="No-Break">it actively?</span></p>
			<p>Having a well-rounded assortment of KPIs is responsible. Doing your due diligence to explore the variety of ways your customers and users interact with your product will go a long way toward not only your product succeeding in delivering value to your customers but also educating your product organization on potential areas of improvement and expansion as far as product features are concerned. This is doubly true for an AI product, which may have fault lines that traditional software products don’t have. Using KPIs to track several behaviors and performance benchmarks is a way for you to keep the feedback loop between your customers and your <span class="No-Break">product alive.</span></p>
			<p>We refer to KPIs and metrics interchangeably in this chapter but there is one crucial difference. A <strong class="bold">metric</strong> is more of a generalized term that applies<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> to something that can be quantifiably measured. A KPI relates to something specific that can be tracked and measured against key business objectives. Not all your metrics will relate to your top-line business objectives, but all your KPIs will be metrics. The point of using these is to see where there needs to be new growth in the adoption of your product. Maybe your north star metric tracks well, but there are dips in your other KPIs. This is an indicator that there might be new product areas to <span class="No-Break">focus on.</span></p>
			<p>The use of KPIs and other metrics is meant to serve as an early warning sign to product managers and leaders about the strength, success, and usability of their product, but beyond that, they also are meant to paint a narrative about why something isn’t going well. This is why the orchestration of your KPIs and metrics is such a <span class="No-Break">thought-intensive process.</span></p>
			<p>You want to use your metrics to help to troubleshoot problems that arise in the moment, such as a bug or an issue with a page, but you also want to use them to help discover areas of the product experience that are suboptimal. You want to understand whether there is a problem with how your product is foundationally built versus whether there is a temporary problem with how the product is being deployed. Using an assortment of metrics to gauge the product experience overall is a best practice for <span class="No-Break">product managers.</span></p>
			<p>You also may have heard the term “vanity metrics” before and this is a point of caution for leaders<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> and product managers alike. <strong class="bold">Vanity metrics</strong> are metrics that are flattering to the company but actually have no real basis for communicating real success or performance. They also don’t tell you what to improve on. Make sure any metrics you’re using, north star or otherwise, all provide the company with <span class="No-Break">important insight.</span></p>
			<p>Establishing metrics that are specific and measurable is a given but they also have to be highly relevant to be justified. Having a high number of unique visitors, sessions, or social media followers might<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> look great for a while, but these markers don’t actually help you<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> in the long run because they aren’t actionable. There’s nowhere to go with that information if those unique visitors arrive accidentally or leave because something’s wrong, if the sessions are accidents or clickbait, or if the social media followers are <span class="No-Break">actually bots.</span></p>
			<p>When you’re looking to establish metrics and KPIs, keep in mind the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How does this metric influence our <span class="No-Break">business/product decisions?</span></li>
				<li>What does this metric actually tell us about our <span class="No-Break">product/customer behavior?</span></li>
				<li>Does the data from this metric actually <span class="No-Break">reflect reality?</span></li>
				<li>Is this metric tied to a part of a specific process we can improve once<a id="_idTextAnchor334"/> we start <span class="No-Break">measuring it?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>OKRs and product strategy</h2>
			<p>Feel free to refer<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> to the<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> introduction<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> on OKRs in <a href="B18935_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor246"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>. To jog<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> your memory, the idea behind <strong class="bold">OKRs</strong> is to tie certain results back to the overarching goals of the company or team. Usually, there are organizational-level OKRs, but individual teams and even individual people can also have them. They arise from a clear, defined goal and are matched with a series of success criteria to constitute the completion of that goal. You look at what you want to achieve and then you set guidelines for knowing when you’ve <span class="No-Break">achieved it.</span></p>
			<p>All of this work of establishing a north star metric and relating it to other organizational metrics and KPIs serves your highest OKRs and, finally, your product strategy as a whole. All of this orchestration is part of the in-depth work that has to be done to align organizational growth with product success. Doing so not only reinforces the product team’s influence on and strategic input into the company but also aligns the entire organization with a higher level of focus <span class="No-Break">and alignment.</span></p>
			<p>Getting all teams committed and oriented toward certain organization-wide goals and tracking metrics that support those goals allow the company to be data-driven and also allow product teams to make data-driven decisions about how their products are used and how that impacts the overall bottom line. OKRs are meant to be ambitious and they’re meant to stretch your organization or <span class="No-Break">team’s capacity.</span></p>
			<p>Creating a measurable, metrics-driven product strategy is optimal, particularly for an AI product, because you need as much visibility as possible into your customers’ experience of your product so that you know what to improve and optimize. Everything we’ve discussed so far – your product vision, your north star metric, your supporting KPIs and metrics, as well as your OKRs – should all support your overarching <span class="No-Break">product strategy.</span></p>
			<p>We love the graphic presented by ProductPlan (<a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-strategy/">https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-strategy/</a>) because it highlights this relationship between<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> product vision and strategy, as well as how that strategy is then applied within the various supporting teams that drive the product forward. The product strategy, which aligns with all the metrics we’ve covered in this chapter, influences how the product interacts with customers and internal teams within the business, how it’s built relative to competing products, and how it will relate to macro trends, with the aim of establishing a <span class="No-Break">product roadmap.</span></p>
			<p>According to the Product Strategy blog (<a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-strategy/">https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-strategy/</a>) published on ProductPlan, “<em class="italic">A product strategy is a high-level plan describing what a business hopes to accomplish with its product and how it plans to do so. The strategy should answer key questions such as who the product will serve (personas), how it will benefit those personas, and the company’s goals for the product throughout its life cycle.</em>” You can think<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> of the product strategy as the overall plan, and the tracking, measurement, and improvement of the metrics and OKRs we discussed as the concrete, tangible way that you will implement <span class="No-Break">that plan.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we’ve covered a few of the key elements involved in building out a product strategy and how to measure the progress of that strategy. There are several options a company can take with this. The direction a company or product team takes is highly dependent on the organization’s specific goals, business model, market strategy, competitive landscape, and overall <span class="No-Break">market conditions.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will cover some<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> of the elements of growth hacking so that an emerging AI/ML-native<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> company or product can get early signals<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> on whether its product is meeting<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> its customers’ expectations, which will help lead to product ma<a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>rket fit and <span class="No-Break">commercial success.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Hacking – product-led growth</h1>
			<p>In the section on north<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> star metrics, we briefly talked about product-led growth and fostering<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> an environment that supports the pursuit of it within the business. The importance of this can’t be understated for an AI/ML product manager. The ultimate goal of building a product strategy, choosing the optimal metrics and KPIs, and getting alignment from your leadership team and main stakeholders is to make your product successful – said in another way, to ultimately achieve product market fit. How does product-led growth relate <span class="No-Break">to this?</span></p>
			<p>There is philosophical debate these days about whether companies should be marketing-led, sales-led, or product-led. Depending on where you are in the ecosystem of a company, you might have a bias for favoring your own designation. As product managers, we might have this bias as well, but if we take marketing- or sales-led growth to its natural conclusion, we <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>might be faced with a predicament. <strong class="bold">Marketing</strong> crafts a message that might resonate beautifully with the audience, but might not actually align with what’s being built. <strong class="bold">Sales</strong> may line up the ideal marquee<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> customers for a company to take on, but they will be forced to reactively dictate what product should be built based on a handful of customer preferences. Neither of these is centered <span class="No-Break">on reality.</span></p>
			<p>The role of a product manager is multifaceted and multidisciplinary, and their involvement with marketing and sales serves as an extension of their own work. A product can’t exist alone. If a product is built and no one hears about it or buys it, does it even exist? There has to be so much extensive work done on research, market analysis, and understanding the competitive landscape and the true needs of the market in order to ideate and build a product that stands <span class="No-Break">a chance.</span></p>
			<p>Often, product management is at the nexus of these activities and is there from the very beginning. That isn’t to say that marketing and sales don’t also spend a considerable amount of time understanding the market. They do, but the product team contextualizes everything in a way that prioritizes what gets built and physically manifests something to promote and sell through marketing <span class="No-Break">and sales.</span></p>
			<p>The best combination<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> of factors is for the product function to take in feedback from the marketing<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> and sales functions in an organization (among the many other sources of feedback), digest that information, and apply it to what’s being built. Then, once it’s gone through that wave, the product function sends out new communication and updates on how the messaging and the product can be improved and optimized. Ideally, this process will happen based on the product <span class="No-Break">experience itself.</span></p>
			<p>In a recent study by Epsilon (<a href="https://www.epsilon.com/us/about-us/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences">https://www.epsilon.com/us/about-us/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences</a>), we can see that 80% of consumers are more likely to stick with a brand when it offers them a personalized experience. According to Forrester (<a href="https://www.forrester.com/what-it-means/ep12-death-b2b-salesman/">https://www.forrester.com/what-it-means/ep12-death-b2b-salesman/</a>), “<em class="italic">68% of B2B buyers prefer doing business online versus with a salesperson, and when they engage with sales, they want that experience to be in a more problem-solving, consultative manner.</em>” The trend toward an increasingly digital market is resulting in a fundamental change to the way we build and ship products because the nature of how we build products must change to meet this trend in both B2B and <span class="No-Break">B2C domains.</span></p>
			<p>It’s not a matter of internal politics. It’s a matter of responding to macroeconomic trends that impact all businesses across the board. Products must be built with a high level of technological optimization whether they’re AI/ML products <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></p>
			<p>The tech stack we’re going to explore in the following section isn’t even necessarily a matter of preference; it’s increasingly becoming a requirement of product teams. We can’t build and optimize a product if we’re feeling around in the dark making decisions on hunches and antiquated business acumen. We’re not proponents of fully automated decision-making. We’re passionate proponents of a collaborative approach in which product managers, technologists, and leaders use their critical thinking and long-term planning skills to make decisions that are backed <span class="No-Break">by data.</span></p>
			<p>It’s also not a matter of unnecessarily surveilling users and customers. If they want personalization, they can’t experience that without some large degree of data collection, analysis, and recommendation. If customers and users want a curated, guided experience in which they can see the value and relevance of a product as soon as it arrives on the scene, product teams will need to become intimately aware of what’s happening under the hood. At the end of the day, the product team largely takes ownership of this data because it’s directly relevant to the work they need to do, which is building and <span class="No-Break">shipping products.</span></p>
			<p>The cornerstone of product-led growth<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> centers on the idea of value. If you’ve built a product that’s instantly<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> able to communicate to its user that it will make their lives much easier and they know that because they can start using it right away, you’ve understood the assignment. How you get there is a <em class="italic">choose-your-own-adventure</em> story. Sifting through the discombobulated mud that is a company’s data heap will involve a rich assortment of platforms and tools. How many products you end up adopting to help you on this adventure will depend on how committed you are to your product-led <span class="No-Break">growth-hacking journey.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at what kinds of tools product managers rely on to s<a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>t<a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>eer their ships in the <span class="No-Break">following section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>The tech stack – early signals</h1>
			<p>Understanding whether<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> your product works for your customers and users or not can be difficult or delayed when you are not set up to get an early signal. Not all companies have the luxury of asking their customers and users directly for feedback that’s comprehensive enough to use to inform decisions. This is why investing in a growth-hacking tech stack is helpful if you’re trying to understand whether your product resonates with your audience, particularly if it’s an <span class="No-Break">AI/ML product.</span></p>
			<p>As you may recall, we discussed the prices associated with building an AI/ML program in <a href="B18935_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> and <a href="B18935_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. Given the high cost of operating, you’ll want to be sure that your product serves the needs of your market and your customers as quickly as <span class="No-Break">you can.</span></p>
			<p>Keep in mind your costs are likely high when managing an AI/ML program, but they’re also dependent on how many AI features you’ve built into your product, particularly if the underlying logic powering your product as a whole is driven by AI/ML. The longer you operate in the dark, the more resources you’ll spend on your product. This means you’ll know later rather than sooner whether it resonates with <span class="No-Break">your customers.</span></p>
			<p>If your organization isn’t set up to make the most of the data you do have, you’ll have to rely on ad hoc channels. These are likely to be direct feedback from customers or a noticeable absence in sales, both of which are unreliable measures because they may not reliably give you true insight into the <em class="italic">why</em>. Think of the categories of tools we will discuss in the following subsections as foundational building blocks you can put in place to set your product and company up for success whether your product is built for other businesses (B2B) or direct <span class="No-Break">consumers (B2C).</span></p>
			<p>We can’t emphasize this enough: investing in the tech infrastructure that will give you the early signal you need to build confidently will save you time and money in the long run. You don’t have to involve everything in the following list, but if you want to set <a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>yourself up sustainably, <span class="No-Break">it’s recommended.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)</h2>
			<p>CDPs are platforms that collect<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> and centralize your customer data from multiple sources into one view for each of your customers so that you can understand who they are, how they find you, what drives their behavior when they do interact with your product, their transactional data, and demographic data. They allow you to leverage the internal data you have into customer profiles so that you can better explore the kinds of customers you’re serving with proof. You might already have channels in place to maintain some of your customer data with systems such as Salesforce and HubSpot, but generally, CDPs also centralize data from <span class="No-Break">those sources.</span></p>
			<p>Their purpose is to collect, unify, and manage your customer data so that you can act on it. Marketing, sales, and your go-to-market team will be important partners for you as an AI/ML product manager, so building strong relationships between these teams through the use of a CDP will be an important step toward making sure your customer base trends in the right direction. If it doesn’t, CDPs will allow you to collaborate with your business development teams on new campaigns to make sure the value of your product is <span class="No-Break">adequately communicated.</span></p>
			<p>Again, because of the high operating costs associated with AI/ML products, you’ll want to develop strong relationships with these externally oriented teams. A big reason for this is to make sure your product language fit resonates with future and current customers so that you initially and continually see value coming from the product you’ve built. This is an important part of establishing an AI/ML-native product because these are products newly entering <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>You won’t yet have an established baseline of what works and what resonates most with your potential/current users. Expect to spend some time on trial and error with your sales, marketing, and go-to-market teams to really get that right so that you can carry on and build<a id="_idIndexMarker519"/> with confidence once you have a secure enough foundation. Reputable CDPs you can explore include Segme<a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>nt, Klaviyo, Hightouch, Insider, <span class="No-Break">and Census.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Customer Engagement Platforms (CEPs)</h2>
			<p>CEPs are a wide category. They are essentially<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> any platforms that allow your customers to reach out to you and for you to reach out to your customers. They allow you to do everything, whether onboarding your new customers or users when they first start working with your product, sending personalized in-app messages or welcome messages, setting up interactive walk-throughs for your users and customers so that they get to know your product, getting them to achieve certain behaviors or milestones with your product, announcing new features or new use cases to your customers and users, or sending out links and driving traffic to certain parts of your overall <span class="No-Break">product experience.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you are a B2B SaaS or B2C company, you’ll want to create some way of connecting with your customers directly beyond an email list. Let’s face it, most of us don’t check those emails as often as companies would like. They lack relevance, and chances are if a customer or user is already in the environment of your product, either in the app or platform, they want to be there and they want to know relevant information about their journey. As a product<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> manager, you should concern yourself with the <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>), user journey, and adoption of your product. CEPs are a great way to create intimacy with your customers and guide them <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>CEPs are also a great way to reduce how much customers reach out to your support teams because they’re confused about how your product works or what they can do with it. They also help drive revenue growth because if there are additional opportunities to upgrade or sell your customers premium features, CEPs help make those options more visible to <span class="No-Break">your customers.</span></p>
			<p>As a product manager, you should be aware of the features that will most delight your customers, so using CEPs is an effective way of managing your customers’ behaviors in-app in a way that gives them the best experience possible. They’re also a great way of gathering feedback through<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> in-app surveys you can deploy throughout your product. Reputable CEPs inc<a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>lude UserPilot, AppCues, WalkMe, <span class="No-Break">and Intercom.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>Product analytics tools</h2>
			<p>Communicating with customers<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> and hearing back from them is a huge help in maintaining an open dialog and keeping the feedback loop alive so that you can continue to build and push out features that customers want, as well as improving features that are hard for customers to interact with and see the value of. However, suppose you don’t want to tell your customers where to go. Suppose you want them to show you where they go, what they do, and how long they do it for. This is where product analytics come <span class="No-Break">in handy.</span></p>
			<p>Product analytics tools allow you to track all sorts of behaviors and create funnels of users to better understand how they physically navigate through your product experience. You can track your customers and users when there are certain events in your app or platform experience, analyze those events en masse, put triggers in place to alert you when certain users perform certain actions, and segment those users so that you can streamline and personalize your communications to them further and create funnels of <span class="No-Break">their journeys.</span></p>
			<p>Typically, product analytics tools come with some built-in KPI tracking and dashboards and let you visualize certain flows and funnels as well. However, if you have a data warehouse in place, you can also send that data over to your warehouse and use a BI tool to analyze it further or pair it with other datasets you might already have in <span class="No-Break">your warehouse.</span></p>
			<p>A typical AI/ML product manager is likely to work regularly with these tools because this is where you can keep your finger on the pulse of your product and get enough of an early signal to at least confirm whether your customers intuitively interact with your product and move through your systems in the way they were originally designed. Even if you don’t use a CEP, a product analytics tool can still give you tons of insight into whether or not there are glaring issues from the outset. As the product continues to mature and evolve, it should also show you whether or not your customer and user base is evolving along with it. Reputable<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> product analytics tools incl<a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>ude Amplitude, Pendo, Mixpanel, Matomo, <span class="No-Break">and Heap.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>A/B testing tools</h2>
			<p>We’ve discussed the concept <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>of optimization at length throughout these chapters, as well as the spirit of experimentation that’s optimal for a growing AI/ML-powered product organization. This is perhaps best captured with A/B testing. While there’s a fair amount of comparison when it comes to the types of models you might employ when building your product with AI/ML features, you will also need to test certain versions of your product with different groups. You’ll likely be A/B testing all sorts of things – how your product looks and feels, which features you put where, how you guide your users, how you track metrics, and which metrics you actually track to inspire the kind of product adoption that will have your audience evangelizing about it on <span class="No-Break">your behalf.</span></p>
			<p>It can be hard to make concrete decisions about what will appeal to your user base most when you design a product, particularly when it’s a novel AI/ML product that’s being released to the market. A/B testing allows you to collect data on which iterations are more successful than others. There are so many routes you can take to optimize the use of your product, how personalized it is, and eventually decide on which iterations best lead to conversions and further revenue. Investing in A/B testing tools not only reinforces a culture of experimentation but also helps you track countless tests and stores the insights from those tests <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>You can once again choose<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> to send this data out to your warehouse and further mine it for insights and append it with other methods of experimentation from the other tools aforementioned in your BI tool, or you can store it on the dashboard of your tool of choice. Either way, A/B tools allow you to organize and keep track of the results of your efforts, allowing you to do hundreds of A/B tests if you need to. You can use these tools to A/B-test anything, whether marketing campaigns, features, buttons, links, colors, fonts, or really anything that you can derive quantitative and qualitative feedback from. Reputable A/B testing tools include VWO, Optimizel<a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>y, AB Tasty, Google<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> Optimize, and Five <span class="No-Break">Second Test.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>Data warehouses</h2>
			<p>A data warehouse<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> will be some kind of relational database that allows you to centralize data much as a CDP does, but the main advantage here is that it formats, transforms, and standardizes that data so that it can be made available for things such as the CDPs above and the BI tools below. You might recall that we covered the importance of data warehouses in <a href="B18935_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>. It suffices to say that you’ll likely need a data warehouse because it serves as the backbone of all relevant company data, customer or otherwise. Think of it as the main artery that pushes data out to various tools. It will also allow you to query the data you have so that you can gain insights <span class="No-Break">from it.</span></p>
			<p>Your data warehouse will be an agnostic place in which your data will live when it’s not actively being called through a direct query or through one of the other tools you hook up to it. When you manage a native AI/ML product, you will think about the success of your product agnostically as well because the truth is success comes from a collection of events. Your product needs to be communicated about with customers and users, but it also needs to be built in a way that directly solves their problems. Your data warehouse will serve as your main source of truth, sending data appropriately to the teams that deal with communication, as well as to the teams that deal <span class="No-Break">with building.</span></p>
			<p>Keep in mind that how you store your data is going to be a pretty big financial and strategic decision. You might opt for a data lake or other relational/non-relational databases that aren’t considered a data warehouse – folks in other roles will likely be making that call. As a product manager, we would advise you to be a foundational part of that conversation because how and where you store your data will have downstream impacts on things such as which other growth-hacking tools you end up adopting and ultimately how much insight you’ll be able to gather from <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></p>
			<p>If your data is in a data<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> lake, you likely won’t interact with it very much. Data warehouses are built for the express purpose of refining your data and getting it ready to push out to other contexts easily. Reputable data warehouses to consider would be Snowfl<a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>ake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, <span class="No-Break">and Databricks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Business Intelligence (BI) tools</h2>
			<p>While your CDP and your data<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> warehouse organize data in a certain way for you to consume, they likely aren’t going to be robust enough for you to explore it effectively. While CDPs are nice for establishing some patterns and understanding the journey of your personas and so forth, they aren’t intended for the exhaustive exploration of your data. You can also technically query data from your data warehouse directly, but you won’t visualize or wrangle that data directly in the warehouse. That’s where BI tools <span class="No-Break">come in.</span></p>
			<p>BI tools allow you to take all the data that’s in your data warehouse, data that’s coming from all sorts of places, and actually analyze it. The purpose of a BI tool is to help you answer important business questions about your data. Data itself, lying in a dormant state, is not helpful or insightful. You have to analyze it to get the treasure, and in this case, that treasure comes in the form of trends, insights, and knowledge. Taking data from a dormant, disparate state, unifying it, and processing it is a tedious process that’s very hard to do without a BI tool. BI tools also allow you to create dashboards for teams to use so that they routinely get a health check on the metrics we outlined earlier in <span class="No-Break">the chapter.</span></p>
			<p>While your data warehouse might serve as your source of truth, you will use your BI tools to understand whether that truth actually reflects reality because it’s virtually the only place you can actually see it. With a BI tool, you don’t just check the validity and visual expression of your data – you create a system of reliance on making data-driven decisions. There will always be an element of risk in the creation and expression of a new product or business. You don’t know how it’s going <span class="No-Break">to go.</span></p>
			<p>BI tools help us see what we do know as clearly as we can and help us minimize that risk. Also, BI tools aren’t just super valuable internally. They also allow us to make visual representations of our data that we can communicate in the form of customer dashboards or through marketing and sales collateral about our products. If you create infographics and sales decks and drive customer communication that involves charts and graphs of your data, these are all likely made through the use of a <span class="No-Break">BI tool.</span></p>
			<p>In essence, a BI tool works as a refinery for your data so that you can further craft the message you want to send out, as well as the message you want to reflect on internally. Notable BI tools inclu<a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>de Power BI, Tableau, Sisense, ThoughtSpot, <span class="No-Break">and Looker.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Growth-hacking tools</h2>
			<p>Finding quick success<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> isn’t just the imperative of an AI/ML product manager but of all product managers and entrepreneurs. Figuring out the best way to make money, increasing brand awareness, and finding quality leads is what growth hacking is all about. Although most products won’t go viral overnight, there is some method in the madness of investing in the tools we went over in previous sections. They all get you closer to the information you need to make present and future decisions in a way that’s informed by what works and what your customer truly wants from you. We went over some broad categories of products that certainly help with growth hacking and finding success with your AI/ML product previously, but there are so many valuable tools out there that don’t fall into those categories <span class="No-Break">per se.</span></p>
			<p>Products such as Expandi allow you to use LinkedIn for social selling campaigns. Crystal Knows uses AI to craft personality profiles to provide insights into behavior and sentiments. Landbot helps you build chatbots to interact with your customers in-app or on your platform. Hotjar allows you to see heat maps and other analytics of where users’ cursors move in your product. UsabilityHub helps you conduct UX research with real users. Fomo helps you build credibility with your brand through transparency and social proofing. Leadfeeder helps you turn your page visitors <span class="No-Break">into leads.</span></p>
			<p>There are endless products out there to help companies achieve the right balance of product market fit. The route you choose will be some combination that keeps the gears of development going but that also allows you to stop and reflect. Processing choices that have been made allows you to assess whether or not those choices are bringing you closer to your ultimate goal of successfully commercializing your <span class="No-Break">AI/ML-native product.</span></p>
			<p>In the following section, we will discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> the costs that contribute to the expense of managing AI pipelines, as well as their impact on pricing. While incorporating AI might come with some efficiencies that should, theoretically, make your price point lower, the total cost of managing an AI program internally is quite high. That cost is often passed onto your customers because it <a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>contributes to the overall cost of running <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Managing costs and pricing – AI is expensive</h1>
			<p>Formulating a pricing strategy<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> will be a highly personalized experience that will involve a number of factors, from the comparative prices of your competition to the operating costs for managing your AI/ML infrastructure and workflows. In this section, we will briefly cover the various aspects of AI product management that impact costs and how to use this knowledge to inform your pricing strategy so that you’re aware of the main contributors to your AI/ML <span class="No-Break">program costs.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s first start with<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> the cost of AI/ML resources themselves. According to WebFX (<a href="https://www.webfx.com/martech/pricing/ai/">https://www.webfx.com/martech/pricing/ai/</a>), most AI consultants charge between $200-$350 an hour and the cost of a custom AI solution is anywhere from $6,000 to $300,000. Using third-party AI software instead can cost anywhere from $0 to $<span class="No-Break">40,000 annually.</span></p>
			<p>It might be tempting to build an AI/ML-native product around consultants, but it’s not the best practice. As soon as something goes wrong, you’ll spend copious amounts of money fixing even modest problems. If you want to hire someone in-house and avoid having to use outside help, you’re looking at an average salary of $162,591 for an ML engineer in New York City. If you want someone to manage a team of ML engineers, you’re looking at an average salary of $207,728 in New <span class="No-Break">York City.</span></p>
			<p>Then, there’s the AI enablement tech stack. Running, maintaining, training, querying, storing, and processing data and AI systems all have costs associated as well. That doesn’t include many of the growth-hacking tools we have already mentioned, which all vary in price as well. Managing all the various vendor relationships, contracts, pricing bands, and caps so that your usage doesn’t grow astronomically will likely warrant its own head count on top of it all. Managing AI/ML infrastructure and empowering a product team to best scale and grow to meet the market that it services is an expensive e<a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>ndeavor, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth <span class="No-Break">the pursuit!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we focused on the tracking, marketing, promotion, and selling of the AI/ML product. We covered the various ways that a product manager can benchmark and track their product and its success using metrics and KPIs, as well as what that means for the greater organization and the successful adoption of that product among its user base. We also contextualized this benchmarking against the overarching product strategy and vision that powers what gets tracked and measured. All these activities help product managers get internal signals into whether or not the product they’ve built works for their active customers <span class="No-Break">and users.</span></p>
			<p>Then, we discussed the greater work of getting external signals on what is and isn’t working using the various tools in the growth tech stack that directly connect to the UX. We went over the elements of growth hacking. Whether you’re looking to optimize how you acquire, engage, or retain customers, you’re going to have to find a way to gather that data, analyze it, and use it to make real decisions about how to add, remove, or improve features. Overarching, long-lasting trends of organizations becoming increasingly data-oriented and data-driven have been massively influential drivers of creating a new culture in the <span class="No-Break">software world.</span></p>
			<p>Customers increasingly look for an experience that doesn’t just feel intuitive and natural, but that reinforces to them over and over again that they’ve come to the right place and that the product they’re interacting with is the right tool for them. They don’t want to have to speak to a live person and they don’t necessarily even want to take what marketing is selling them. They want to interact with a product directly and see whether its inherent value is apparent through their own exploration. This is a massive shift from how products were built and sold in the past and this means that our responsibility as product managers is to offer an experience that aligns with how customers want to <span class="No-Break">be regarded.</span></p>
			<p>We’re delighted that we’ve entered a new era in which we aren’t playing coy anymore. Customers and users know they are being tracked and they’re putting us to the test. Customers and users want us to use our intelligence on them in order to give them an experience that won’t insult their intelligence and we’re here for it. It’s a brave new <em class="italic">help me, help you</em> world, and we think it’s about time we use all this data to make the UX simpler than it has <span class="No-Break">ever been.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter concludes <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of our book, and so far, we’ve covered a wide variety of topics for the AI-native product. In this part, we discussed how AI/ML-native products are built and productized, and we also examined the notion of customization and verticalization within AI products, as well as a few popular ways AI capabilities and features are built into products. Understanding how AI products are natively built gives us good context for the next and final part of our book, which is about integrating AI into existing traditional software products. We will begin this third part of our book with <a href="B18935_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor361"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, which will focus on the pervasive influence of AI and the impact it has <span class="No-Break">across industries.</span></p>

			<p>Many companies will embark on the journey of integrating AI and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) into their existing products because of the competitive advantage and strategic influence that AI has <span class="No-Break">across industries.</span></p>
			<p>The third part of this book will focus on evolving existing products that don’t currently use ML or <strong class="bold">deep learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">DL</strong>) to leverage AI. In the previous part, we discussed building an AI-native product and how the process unfolds in a way that’s optimal from a data, company, and strategy perspective. Using this same lens, we will now compare and contrast how this process unfolds for products that don’t currently leverage AI. By the end of this part, we’ll understand the impact and scale AI is having on individual companies and the industries they’re a part of. We will end this part with a comprehensive guide to bringing AI/ML capabilities into traditional <span class="No-Break">software products.</span></p>
			<p>This part comprises the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>
