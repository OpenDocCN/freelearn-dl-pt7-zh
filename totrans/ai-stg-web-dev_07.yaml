    the characteristics of items and recommends those that are similar to the ones
    the user has shown interest in. Deep learning models, our disco ball, reflect

    behavior patterns that frequently occur in sequence, allowing for the prediction
    of future actions. Supervised learning, our music producer, predicts the user’s
