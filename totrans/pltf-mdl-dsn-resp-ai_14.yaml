    lead to disparate outcomes for a wide range of people based on their socio-demographic
    (gender, race, or other attributes deemed sensitive) backgrounds. Hence, as AI
    designers, it is of utmost importance that we study the customer segment well
    to formulate our solutions. We know that in the retail world, the customer profile
    plays a dominant role in determining the lifetime value of the customer to a company.
    Consequently, the customer profile, along with their browsing history, leads to
    decisions where promotions, discounts, and coupons can be granted based on their
    clickstream sessions (series of events taking place in the user’s browsing sessions).
    However, even after considering those factors, it has been found that the act
    of incentivizing a purchase (Koehn et al., 2020, *Predicting online shopping behaviour
    from clickstream data using deep learning*, `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420301676`)
    may lead to a coupon distribution where consumers belonging to a certain social,
    demographical, or cultural background receive biased and unfair treatment over
    others, generating negative sentiments for those consumers who did not receive
    the discounts. An example to illustrate this is when discounts are unevenly distributed
    and primarily targeted at people from high-income households that have a higher
    likelihood of making a purchase, excluding people residing in low-income households
    from discounts.

    female and male users, concluding with the fact that even gender acts as a proxy
    and gives rise to biased models. It has been found from statistical data that
    female users tend to have higher browsing frequency and spend a greater amount
    of time per session on a web page. With an increase in browsing time, the backend
    processing engines of e-commerce platforms always assume that female users demonstrate
    a greater likelihood of purchasing than their male counterparts. However, this
    may not be the same for all males and females for all age groups. Even age plays
    an important factor in yielding different distributions, where the mean age for
    a female is considerably higher than that for a male. To eliminate the use of
    unbiased data in our ML models, we need to apply the principle of equalized odds

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is rather propelled by the economics of the given region. Examples include ad
    delivery techniques driving the observed differences (for example, a higher price
    premium for high-cost ad keywords).

    AI solutions, as studied in [*Chapter 5*](B18681_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110), *Fairness
    in Data Collection*, techniques such as the omission of sensitive attributes may
    not be sufficient alone. This is because other attributes may act as proxies and
    would result in inherent bias in the predicted outcomes. One such example can
    be seen in e-commerce, where AI considers a user’s browsing history to predict
    the most successful advertising content to show. One major drawback of this approach
    is that information on browsing history is often used as a proxy for gender (for
    example, `github.com` as a proxy for men and `pinterest.com` as a proxy for women).
    Further, in [*Chapter 8*](B18681_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176), *Fairness in Model
    Training and Optimization*, we learned about the importance of constraints in
    algorithmic optimizers that can control bias.

    it is important to be able to identify regular as well as big-fish customers per
    store, the latter of which contribute significantly toward the overall monthly

    of winter coincide with Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year, and other festivals
    where people generally exchange gifts. Hence, social media marketers on e-commerce
    platforms need to consider the CFs by studying the impact on sales had there been

    irrespective of whether they opened the email or used the rewards program. But
    this does not prevent the dilution effect where individuals in treatment groups
    (more suitable in the context of multiple treatment groups) are treated differently.
    To address and evaluate the impact of actually receiving the treatment, we can
    use the **Compiler Average Causal Effect** (**CACE**), where CACE adjusts the
    **Intention-to-Treat** (**ITT**) effect (that is, the effect of being assigned
    treatment, which means being subjected to the test conditions under consideration)
    with the compliance rate. This is because the ITT parameter underestimates the
    efficacy of an intervention. After all, certain individuals may deviate from their
    assigned treatment in trials.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This adjustment helps to estimate the treatment effect for the subpopulation
    that is being treated or being considered for the experimentation. Treatment here
    refers to the experimental group that experiences the test conditions. The CACE
    framework relies on the assumption that customers open the email and use the rewards
    program, and the effect of receiving the actual treatment (customer group receiving
    the reward program) drives the outcome variable. To summarize, CACE operates through
    **Instrumental V****ariables** (**IVs**), which determine the causal relationships
    when controlled experiments are not feasible.
  prefs: []

    Estimation** (**HTE**) method of causal inference is recommended to identify customized
    experiences that can be optimally applied for the benefit of everyone. In this
    method, the **Conditional Average Treatment Effect** (**CATE**) is deployed successfully
    to compute the treatment effect and operates conditionally on observed covariates.
    The main objective of this method is to evaluate which subgroup of a given population
    will benefit the most when subjected to treatment. The evaluation is carried out
    with the help of A/B testing, where experimental data is used to train the model.
    The metric represents an upliftment success and is evaluated by computing the
    largest delta (or difference) between the target (to whom the treatment is applied)
    and the control group. Uber applies HTE by using its uplift modeling. Quantile
    regression (which estimates the conditional median of the response variable) is

    of a back-door path (a kind of dependency) between the treatment variable and
    the outcome of interest. Causal inferencing supports observational analysis, where
    we attempt to block back-door paths. This can be done by limiting the number of
    orders to, say, three or four. Determining which variables should and should not
    be controlled involves collaboration between domain experts and data scientists.
    Additionally, a biased estimation resulting from the back-door path between delayed
    deliveries and customer engagement can be tackled if we can identify a third variable
    that impacts the outcome of delayed delivery on customer experience.

    which requires the introduction of an intervening variable (mostly used in clinical
    research) other than the treatment (that is, the outcome) and is popularly known
    as **Causal Mediation Analysis** (**CMA**). It plays an important role in dissecting

    the variables through a predicted probability score. This probability helps us

    useful in determining how different levels of **dynamic pricing** influence customers’
    decisions to buy an item from a retail store or book a trip on the Uber platform.

    the assumption that riders who are very close to the cut-off point resemble each
    other with respect to relevant confounding variables (a third variable that influences
    both the independent and dependent variables). Further, observing any noticeable
    discontinuity in trip request rates at the point of introduction of surge pricing
    is an indication that raising prices beyond this point has a causal impact on
    request rates.

    decision-makers to evaluate the trustworthiness of the loan application and at
    the same time guide them with the necessary conditions (such as existing loans
    or income) that are driving the outcome, such as a loan denial CF explanations
    over multiple inputs, help them to evaluate fairness criteria, and reduce errors.

    that are diverse and feasible. Hence, an extension of DiCE was created, known
    as **DiCE4EL** (short for **DiCE for Event Logs** – see more at [https://icpmconference.org/2021/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/DiCE4EL_-Interpreting-Process-Predictions-using-a-Milestone-Aware-Counterfactual-Approach.pdf](https://icpmconference.org/2021/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/DiCE4EL_-Interpreting-Process-Predictions-using-a-Milestone-Aware-Counterfactual-Approach.pdf)),
    which assists with CF explanations for process prediction by capturing and explaining
    logs (such as those regarding loan applications made to a financial institution)
    and events at the intermediate stages. DiCE was designed using a generic neural
    network architecture that predicts the next event by considering both static and
    dynamic features. We can use this to resolve scenarios where we have long traces
    of process execution logs that are less understandable. Furthermore, the difficulties
    encountered in optimizing the CF search with categorical variables are addressed
    by the introduction of a search for valid CFs in the training set and leveraging
    that information in the loss function.

    recordings, or photos of humans generated using deep learning methods. The generated
    synthetic videos, audio, and photos of humans are obtained by training models
    on large volumes of data, where the modeled versions represent modified actions
    or utterances of words or sentences that the actual person had nothing to do with.
    As the original actions are modified, there is an unprecedented threat of deepfakes
    being used to impersonate individuals, resulting in fraudulent phone calls or
    video conferences. An example of this is using synthetic voice audio of a CEO
    to instruct staff to transfer assets or funds. Even higher levels of security

    to promote their sales through e-commerce platforms. For example, Cadbury used
    AI based ML models to recreate a popular actor's face and voice, bearing very
    close resemblance to the actor's voice, uttering the local store or brand’s name.
    Retailers are exploring realistic digital models and the power of **Generative

    Deepfake models demonstrate outfits with different skin tones, heights, and weights,

    on the occurrence or likelihood of adverse events such as disease, hospitalization,
    and mortality. To solve such problems, we often use survival analysis, a statistical
    measure that can predict the time to failure and time to occurrence of events.
    In addition, survival analysis is capable of handling censoring (a kind of missing
    data problem) when expected events do not happen during the study, either because
    subjects of interest have not participated in the study or have left the study
    before the study ended. In such situations, a researcher might have partial information
    available on the survival times for the patients during the pandemic – for example,
    where patients were found to die due to diseases other than the virus. An example
    of this is when researchers wanted to study the average time it took for patients
    to start showing signs of infection of the virus but were missing data of individuals
    on account of not having proper data collection processes in place to authentically
    collect data over the period when a virus infects a patient’s body.
