- en: Python is a programming language that provides various features in the field
    of data science. In this book, we will be touching upon two Python libraries,
    scikit-learn and TensorFlow. We will learn about the various implementations of
    ensemble methods, how they are used with real-world datasets, and how they improve
    prediction accuracy in classification and regression problems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book starts with studying ensemble methods and their features. We will
    look at how scikit-learn provides the right tools to choose hyperparameters for
    models. From there, we will get down to the nitty-gritty of predictive analytics
    and explore its various features and characteristics. We will be introduced to
    artificial neural networks, TensorFlow, and the core concepts used to build neural
    networks.

    improved methods, and software enhancements for efficient predictive analytics.
    You will become well versed in using DNNs to solve common challenges.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data analysts, software engineers, and machine learning developers
    who are interested in implementing advanced predictive analytics using Python.
    Business intelligence experts will also find this book indispensable as it will
    teach them how to go from basic predictive models to building advanced models
    and producing better predictions. Knowledge of Python and familiarity with predictive
    analytics concepts are assumed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book presents some of the most advanced predictive analytics tools, models,
    and techniques. The main goal is to show the viewer how to improve the performance
    of predictive models, firstly, by showing how to build more complex models, and
    secondly by showing how to use related techniques that dramatically improve the
    quality of predictive models.
