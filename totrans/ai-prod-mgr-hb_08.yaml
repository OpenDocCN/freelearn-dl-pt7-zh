    across **verticals**, **customers**, and **customer peer groups**. The purpose
    of this analysis is to understand how you can start to think of product management’s
    role in orienting **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) products for specialized
    groups and, ultimately, what AI allows you to do for those groups. **AI** and
    **machine learning** (**ML**) are powerful tools but have a general power that
    needs to be applied specifically in order for their value to be fully understood.
    In many ways, the work of a **product manager** (**PM**) is to make that value
    as obvious as possible to everyone, from customers to developers.

    with designing the product, organizing the workflow as that product evolves, analyzing
    feedback from your customers, incorporating that feedback into your overarching
    business goals, researching new methods and improvements, building the greater
    product strategy that aligns with your company’s strategy, and, ultimately, communicating
    across all levels to all your stakeholders, developers, and leaders. This requires
    a lot of understanding, intimacy, and commitment to your product and its success!

    to consider. You’ll want to understand the options you have in terms of ML algorithms
    and data models, as well as understanding how AI will move the needle as far as
    your acceptance criteria and key metrics are concerned. You’ll also want to have
    an understanding of data privacy and AI ethics to make sure you aren’t building
    something that might cause harm to any of your customers or the greater business
    down the line.

    Gaining an intuition about how to use data, how to apply data to specific use
    cases, and understanding a bit about statistics and the data models themselves
    will be crucial to making sure you’ve got enough of an understanding to be confident
    as an AI PM. This area is, in many ways, a prerequisite to being able to start
    your AI PM career. As an AI PM, you’ll be working with data heavily. Critical
    thinking and complex problem-solving will be necessary to build a successful product
    that best aligns with the specific use case for your AI product. As the chapter
    continues, we’ll be exploring the most common use cases, domains, verticals, and
    peer groups that AI is leveraged in.

    The four quadrants themselves are built on an *x* axis based on the completeness
    of vision, and a *y* axis based on the ability to execute. We’re not able to share
    the visuals of this here in this book but we encourage you to use Gartner’s magic
    quadrant as a resource when evaluating your organization’s placement in your own
    market, as well as the placement of your biggest competitors. Your ability to
    gauge where you fall along these fault lines will best prepare you for coming

    ideating and positioning your product because it’s so new and it’s entering a
    new market. In the following sections, we will be focusing on the work of positioning
    a product appropriately for your market, understanding how your product design

    based on the most complete vision. These guys can show you what’s been working
    and what needs the main market players in the domain are predominately addressing.
    This will be valuable for you to get a sense of what the addressable market actually
    wants out of the companies that serve them. Leaders are also great for showing
    their domains what a sustainable execution of domain pain points looks like, as
    they’ve been around for a long time and fellow PMs can learn from the products
    they’ve released and how the greater market has received them over the years.
    Leaders offer a great foundation for research when you’re in a new domain as a
    PM.

    to address the needs of their market well enough to take some of the market share
    away from leaders. This is a helpful dynamic to understand when you’re thinking
    about your own product. If challengers are able to take a market share from the
    leaders in their domains, it means there are potential fault lines to tap into.
    Those fault lines are areas where leaders are not addressing the needs of their
    market adequately and the most successful challengers are able to find opportunities
    in those fault lines.

    help you potentially identify features or use cases for your product as you’re
    building and designing that have some proven success. These edge cases might be
    so niche that the challengers and leaders themselves don’t find them strategic
    to build into their existing product suites, but for an emerging product, this
    knowledge could be valuable. Getting an understanding of what niches exist within
    your domain will show you where there might be latent areas of growth that are
    currently untapped or underserved.

    a robust vision for their product suite and, likely, their entire domain. Visionaries
    are able to show you what’s possible from a product in your chosen domain and
    will likely include some of the most cutting-edge features you’re likely to find
    in your space. As an AI PM, you’ll see most of your direct competitors here because
    AI features are still slow to adopt in most domains, and we would wager that most
    of these players are starting to experiment with AI capabilities.

    further in our UEBA section, but for now, keep in mind that understanding how

    product MVP will start somewhere but after that, there needs to be a course for
    your product vision to grow toward. Remember that completeness of vision was one
    of the *x* axes in the Gartner magic quadrant? The reason for this is that an
    addressable market has a variety of needs ranging in complexity. Your product
    MVP will only solve a small fraction of these needs. Your leadership and company
    goals will likely not be to solve all the needs of your market, but you will need

    – and these language models are used to find patterns in what end users are asking
    for to inform things such as a centralized knowledge base, a frequently asked
    questions page, or to help the company understand more about their customers and

    has to do with catching fraud more efficiently. In this use case, AI is being
    used for anomaly detection within accounts so that banks and other financial institutions
    can be alerted faster when an activity that’s outside an existing customer’s pattern
    of behavior is identified. This is also used for money laundering and other illegal
    activities.

    version of continuous data mining is at play to discover whether there are overarching,
    easy-to-detect patterns in the customer data. There’s also likely to be a rules-based
    system that’s used to mine as it’s scouring the data and looking for anomalies.
    On top of this, there are likely unsupervised ML models used to look for patterns
    beyond the mining and to group activities into clusters to be analyzed later,
    and there are often neural networks used as well to learn from established suspicious
    patterns that do turn out to be fraudulent.'

    potential cybercrimes through the help of various layers of AI. Setting up this
    kind of in-depth operation is expensive, but the cost to run a system like that
    is nothing in the face of the $51M fintech loses to fraud every year. With regard
    to fraud detection, there are also temporal qualities to it, so fintech is often
    looking at finding fraud that has occurred, finding fraud as it’s occurring, and
    finding and stopping fraud before it happens.

    technology that supports it is based on predictive analytics. Fintech players
    are able to crunch so much data and they’re so committed to improving their ML
    models that even small percentages of improvement in their accuracy or precision
    could result in millions of dollars of saved revenue or maximized profits. Whether
    they’re a start-up that’s looking to convert a lead or a bank that’s looking to
    offer a loan based on a credit score, fintech is using predictive analytics to
    constantly learn from new and historical data to power most of their decisions
    so that they know how much a potential customer transaction is worth to them in
    the long run.

    and ultrasounds are all available to be analyzed en masse. AI is able to help
    make sense of these images that exist, as well as learn from new graphics and
    images that are produced as people continue with their medical activities. The

    detection. In cybersecurity, this established baseline and deviation from it are
    what create the use case of anomaly detection. Once there’s been an anomaly and
    an action is required from the system, we can then move toward rectifying it somehow.
    Often, cyber attacks come from within networks and have clever ways of hiding
    their tracks, but with advanced pattern recognition that’s used for anomaly detection,
    AI systems can see when some actor/user is behaving in ways that don’t make sense
    for a normal user.

    to power those applications of AI. One of these overarching use cases is encapsulated
    in UEBA, which is, in many ways, an undercurrent for many of the use cases we
    discussed. As an AI PM, it will be really helpful if you can understand the power
    of UEBA and how to apply it within your product and beyond, particularly as you’re
    in the operational phase of building out increasingly powerful features over time.

    pooling all your users’ actions and subsequent data that is generated from those
    actions on a daily basis. Once all this data is centralized and analyzed, it’s
    able to offer you profound insights by giving you a baseline for not just individual
    users but for all your users all at once as well. This makes things such as finding
    anomalies or new patterns, no matter what the change is, easier because you can
    establish triggers or actions that alert your user or your internal workforce
    when something that requires attention has happened.
