    like VWO, Adobe Target, and AB Tasty provide powerful tools for comparing different
    versions of your AI models. By testing multiple variations simultaneously, you
    can gather data on the performance of each version and make data-driven decisions
    on which model performs best. A/B testing allows you to iterate and refine your
    models based on real-world results, ensuring continuous improvement and optimal
    performance.

    algorithm: Model A (current) and Model B (new version). To determine which model
    performs better, you can set up an A/B test. Half of your users interact with
    Model A and the other half with Model B. You would monitor metrics such as click-through
    rates, conversion rates, and user engagement times. If Model B shows higher click-through
    and conversion rates, you might decide to adopt it as the new standard. By iterating
    based on these real-world results, you ensure your AI models continuously improve
    and align with user needs.'
