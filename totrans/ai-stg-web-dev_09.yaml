- en: This project demonstrated how to create an AI-powered movie recommendation chatbot
    using the MovieLens dataset and the `Surprise` library. While this example provided
    a basic implementation, there are several limitations to consider for real-world
    applications. The model needs to handle contextual understanding and error paths,
    as well as integrate with existing movie databases. Additionally, employing generative
    AI can enhance human-like interactions and make recommendations feel more natural
    and personalized. Using ML models such as collaborative filtering for personalized
    content recommendations is just the beginning; further refinements are necessary
    to create a fully functional and user-friendly chatbot.
