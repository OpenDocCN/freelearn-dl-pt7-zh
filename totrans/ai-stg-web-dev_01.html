			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">The term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">human-centered AI</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1"> was first coined by Ben Shneiderman (a professor of computer </span><a id="_idIndexMarker115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">science at the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.1">University of Maryland) and Catherine Plaisant, in their 2010 book, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.1">Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.2">Shneiderman and Plaisant defined HCAI as an approach to AI that “places human needs and values at the center of AI development </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.1">and use.”</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.1">However, the principles of HCAI had already been discussed by philosophers and computer scientists for decades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.2">In 1967, philosopher John McCarthy, one of the pioneers of AI, wrote that “AI should be designed to serve human interests.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.3">And in 1985, computer scientist Alan Newell, one of the founders of cognitive AI, wrote that “AI should be used to improve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.765.1">human life.”</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.1">HCAI has gained momentum over the last decade as AI has become more powerful and widespread. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.2">A growing number of organizations, including companies, governments and non-governmental organizations, are working to develop guidelines and standards for the development and use of AI in an ethical and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.767.1">responsible way.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.1">Here are some of the main authors who have contributed to the development of HCAI: Ben Shneiderman, John McCarthy, Alan Newell, Helen Nissenbaum, Luciano Floridi,  John Danaher, Kate Crawford, and Safiya Noble. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.2">These authors have written on a wide range of topics related to HCAI, including ethics, accountability, transparency, fairness, and inclusion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.3">Their work has helped shape the debate on the future of AI and ensure that the technology is used for the good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.769.1">of humanity.</span></span></p>
