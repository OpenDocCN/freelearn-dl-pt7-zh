    networking industry, and how they affect the way wireless networking brands are
    positioned in the marketplace. This will lay the framework for understanding why
    data-driven and AI-powered solutions are needed.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wireless networking industry is undergoing a period of significant change.
    The growth in mobile usage and **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) devices, as well
    as the demand for hotspots, has created an unprecedented surge in demand for connectivity
    – and the need for new ways to meet this demand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number of unique users connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots has quadrupled
    over the past 5 years, according to Statista ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/677108/global-public-wi-fi-hotspots/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/677108/global-public-wi-fi-hotspots/)).
    Since 2019, there have been more mobile devices than people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    who must invest     heavily in infrastructure to handle the increased demand. Wireless networking
    operators are increasingly responsible for providing a reliable and scalable network
    that will meet the growing demand of users.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This growth in traffic has important implications for network performance. Network
    performance continues to be an issue that plagues both wired and wireless networks
    globally because there are only so many antennas available for signal amplification,
    satellites are expensive to launch into space, and cell towers must contend with
    interference from other wireless networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these limitations don't mean that network performance has been stagnant;
    quite the contrary. We continue to see advancements in network architecture thanks
    in large part to advancements in **software-defined networking** (**SDN**), which
    creates virtual networks within an existing physical infrastructure using software,
    instead of hardware components such as switches or routers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SDN allows networks operators to dynamically shape traffic patterns across connected
    devices without impacting end-user experiences such as speed or latency. This
    flexibility allows operators greater control over how they utilize their network
    infrastructure which can then be used strategically – think about allocating resources
    to certain types of applications rather than having applications compete against
    each other for limited bandwidth resources when running simultaneously on one
    device, network connection, or geographic region.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this level of control comes great responsibility; providers must make sure
    that users aren't negatively impacted during times when demand outweighs available
    capacity, which results in slower download speeds or dropped connections.
  prefs: []

    opportunity for brands that are able to capitalize on it with innovative products
    and services tailored around consumers' specific needs and preferences.

    they''d get from competing brands or non-branded alternatives. This valuable information
    can be extracted from product and consumer data, including product reviews from
    sources such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target.'

    tablets and laptops can be used for productivity purposes, while smartphones are
    more often used for social media or entertainment. Meanwhile, wearables can be
    used for health monitoring, smart speakers can be used for listening to podcasts

    overcome is the need to become more data-driven. Many consumers today are bombarded
    by so much information every day that they often feel overwhelmed and incapable
    of making informed decisions when it comes to their wireless connectivity needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will be able to establish a distinct advantage over competitors that may not be

    delivery of real-time insights and data analytics that can help them understand
    how best to serve their customers' specific wireless connectivity needs – and
    in turn, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it so challenging for brands that are looking to capitalize on this opportunity.
    There are still many questions surrounding its rollout and adoption rates, meaning
    that there's no guarantee that consumers will want to buy into the experience
    or use their wireless connectivity products and services in the same way as they
    have with previous generations of networks.
  prefs: []

    network coverage as well as customer education about the benefits of ultra-low
    latency connectivity – the potential for growth in demand for 5G products and
    services will increase significantly. This means that if you can figure out how
    to create a compelling user experience for your customers around ultra-low latency
    connectivity, then you could see tremendous growth as more people become early
    adopters of this new capability.

    starts using it. The consumer may post a positive review on Amazon about how easy
    it is to set up the device and use it around the house. This review can help improve
    product satisfaction and usage among other consumers who read the review. The

    features consumers liked most about their device and use that information to improve
    future products.
