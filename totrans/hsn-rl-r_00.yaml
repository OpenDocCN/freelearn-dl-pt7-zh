- en: Reinforcement learning is an exciting part of machine learning. It has a variety
    of uses in technology, ranging from autonomous cars to game playing. Reinforcement
    learning creates algorithms that can learn and adapt to environmental changes.

- en: This book provides a hands-on approach to the implementation of reinforcement
    learning. It will explore interesting practical examples, such as using tabular
    Q-learning to control robots. It also explores associated methodologies that will
    have you up and running in no time.

- en: We'll introduce the underlying concepts of reinforcement learning. We will cover
    the agent-environment interface, Markov decision process, and policy gradient
    methods. We will then use the R libraries available to develop a model based on
    Markovian chains. We will examine the multi-armed bandit problem. Applying dynamic
    programming and Monte Carlo methods, we will find the best policy and make predictions.
    Finally, we will use temporal difference learning for vehicle routing problem
    applications. Later, we will apply the concepts learned so far to real-life problems.
    We will start from the world of games, and then move on to financial problems
    such as fraud detection. From the world of health care, we will see how you can
    use TD learning to detect cancers.

- en: And finally, we will explore deep reinforcement learning. This involves using
    algorithms based on neural networks to increase the potential of reinforcement
    learning. We will approach reinforcement learning by using the Keras model. Finally,
    we will see what the next challenges of reinforcement learning are.
