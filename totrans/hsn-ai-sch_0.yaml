- en: With the emergence of big data and modern technologies, artificial intelligence
    (AI) has acquired a lot of relevance in many domains. The increase in demand for
    automation has generated many applications for AI in fields such as robotics,
    predictive analytics, and finance.

- en: 'This book will give you an understanding of what AI is. It explains basic search
    methods in detail: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*
    Search, which can be used to make intelligent decisions when the initial state,
    end state, and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions
    can be found for such problems, but they are not optimal in terms of either space
    or time, and efficient approaches to space and time will be explored. We will
    also look at how to formulate a problem, which involves identifying its initial
    state, goal state, and the actions that are possible in each state. We also need
    to understand the data structures involved while implementing these search algorithms,
    because they form the basis of search exploration. Finally, we will look into
    what a heuristic is, because this decides the suitability of one sub-solution
    over another and helps you decide which step to take.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for developers who are keen to get started with AI and develop
    practical AI-based applications. Developers who want to upgrade their normal applications
    to smart and intelligent versions will find this book useful. A basic knowledge
    and understanding of Python are assumed.

- en: '[Chapter 1](50419d40-ab0f-4d63-9447-295dc802574c.xhtml)*, Understanding the
    Depth-First Search Algorithm*, practically explains the DFS algorithm with the
    help of a search tree. The chapter also delves into recursion, which eliminates
    the need to have an explicit stack.'

    Heuristic Search Algorithm*, takes you through the priority queue data structure
    and explains how to visualize search trees. The chapter also covers problems related
    to greedy best-first search, and how A* solves that problem.'
