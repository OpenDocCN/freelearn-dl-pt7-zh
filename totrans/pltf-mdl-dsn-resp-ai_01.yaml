- en: This chapter gives a detailed overview of defining and evaluating a **Machine
    Learning** (**ML**) risk framework from the instant an organization plans to embark
    on AI digital transformation. Risks may come in different stages, such as when
    the strategic or financial planning kicks in or during several of the execution
    phases. Risks start surfacing with the onset of technical implementations and
    continue up to testing phases when the AI use case is served to customers. Risk
    quantification can be attained through different metrics, which can certify the
    system behavior (amount of robustness and resiliency) against risks. In the process
    of understanding risk evaluation techniques, you will also get a thorough understanding
    of attacks and threats to ML models. In this context, you will discover different
    components of the system having security or privacy bottlenecks that pose external
    threats and make the model open to vulnerabilities. You will get to know the financial
    losses and business impacts when models deployed in production are not risk and
    threat resilient.

    to the poor performance of the model for a selected customer segment or during
    a specific period (for example, many business predictions were affected by the

    ML models answering questions about the behavior of the model raises stakeholder
    confidence. In addition to deploying an optimized model that can give the right

    that affect the decisions it makes. However, it’s up to the ML/AI practitioners

    healthcare industry needs the intervention of doctors and healthcare experts to
    adopt different **active learning** strategies to learn about rare diseases and

    ML life cycle. Attacks and threats are much too specific to input data, feature
    engineering, model training, deployment, and the way the model is served to its
    customers. Hence it is essential to design and evaluate any ML model against a
    **threat matrix** (more details on threat matrices will be discussed in [*Chapter
    2*](B18681_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040)). The most important factors that must be
    taken into consideration are the model's objective, optimization function, mode
    of learning (centralized versus federated), human-to-machine (or machine-to-machine)
    interaction, environmental factors (for designing policies and rewards in the
    case of reinforcement learning), feedback, retraining, and deployment. These factors,
    along with the model design and its explainability, will push organizations to
    go for a more transparent and explainable ML model and remove ML models that are
    overly complex, opaque, and unexplainable. The threat matrix can safeguard ML
    models in deployment by not only evaluating model performance but also testing
    models for adversarial attacks and other external factors that cause ML models
    to drift.

    provide a direct threat to privacy and may leak private information ([https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/)).
    Hence, model risk mitigation mechanisms must employ individual feature assessment
    to confirm included features’ impact (mathematical transformation and decision
    criteria) on the business rationale. The role of feature creation can be best
    understood in a specific credit modeling use case by banks where the ML model
    can predict defaulters based on the engineered feature of debt-to-income ratio.

    whether they are available for local use (white box) or deployed in a cloud setup
    (Google, Amazon, or Azure) and served by means of a prediction query. Amazon and
    Google provide services to train ML models in a black-box manner. Both Google
    (Vertex AI) ([https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview))
    and AWS have partial feature extraction techniques' documentation available in
    their manuals. With the increased scope of privacy breaches in a deployed model,
    it is easier for an attacker to attack and steal training data and ML models.
    Attackers are motivated to steal ML models to avoid prediction query charges.
    *Figure 1**.13* illustrates different categories of attacks under training and
    testing. We have also mentioned defense techniques, which will be discussed more
    in [*Chapter 2*](B18681_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040), *Emergence of Risk-Averse

- en: In this type of fuzzy-style attack, the attacker modifies the model query by
    sending adversarial examples to input models with the goal of misclassifying the
    model and violating its integrity. Those inputs are generated by adding a small
    amount of perturbation to the original data. Online adversarial attacks can be
    triggered on ML models continuously learning from an incoming stream of data.
    Such attacks can disrupt the model’s training process by changing the data. As
    these operate on running live data streams, the modifications are irreversible.
    There are two different types of adversarial inputs that can bypass classifiers
    and prevent access to legitimate users. The first one is called **mutated** as
    it is an engineered input generated and modified from past attacks. The second
    type of input is a **zero-day input**, which is seen for the first time in the

    information related to the model. Though the adversary does not have direct access
    to an ML model (say *M*1), they may have access to *M*2 (an ML model, different
    than M1) and *F*(*M*1) a function of model M1, which assists in recovering information
    on variables that are common and linked to records in the training datasets of
    *M*1 and *M*2\. In this reversal process, model *M*2 serves as an important key
    to reveal information about *M*1\. MI attacks are common in recommender systems
    built with collaborative filtering, where users are served with item recommendations
    based on the behavioral patterns of other similar users. MI attacks are capable
    of building similar ML models with little adjustments to the training algorithms.
    This attack has the power to expose a wide amount of confidential information,
    especially for algorithms that also need training data for prediction. For example,

    explained by Fredrikson et al.) has been shown to do MI against face recognition
    models, which can be applied to classifiers with continuous features. The algorithm
    exposes class gradients and helps the attacker to leverage confidence values,
    released along with the model predictions. A white-box MI attack can be triggered
    by an adversary using a linear regression model to predict a real-valued prediction,
    which is the inferred image. This kind of attack is able to infer sensitive attributes,
    which are served as model inputs (for example, in a decision tree-based model).
    Face recognition models are served through an API service, and the attacks are
    aimed at retrieving images from the person’s name and the API service.

    defenses of back-door attacks. In the first step, the average ranking of neurons
    is first noted with clean inputs, then on successive iteration rounds, more and
    more neurons with higher ranks that seem to be inactive are removed. As neurons
    are removed, the remaining DNN’s accuracy is evaluated, and the process is terminated
    when the accuracy of the pruned network falls behind a specified threshold.

    using an autoencoder, which helps to evaluate and minimize the reconstruction
    error arising out of the validation dataset and the Trojan input. Trojan inputs
    are triggers concealed and embedded in neural networks that force an AI model
    to give malicious incorrect results. Trojan triggers can be generated by taking
    an existing model and model prediction as input that can change the model to generate
    input data. Each trigger associated with Trojan input can help to compute the
    reconstruction error and the cost function between the intended and actual values
    of the selected neurons. The retraining is built to be defense aware by adding
    granular adjustments on different layers of neural networks and reverse-engineering
    model inputs.

    changing the model decision boundary. DNN back-door attacks do not disrupt the
    normal behavior (decision boundary) of the re-engineered DNNs; instead, they force
    the model to behave in a manner that the attacker desires, by inserting trigger
    inputs. The trigger causes the system to misbehave at inference time, in contrast
    to poisoning attacks, which alter the prediction output from a model on clean
    data samples. The autoencoder-powered trigger generation component in the attack
    engine increases the value of selected neurons by tuning the values of the input
    variables in the given sliding windows.

    who are not trusted users can download the pretrained weights and inject the weights
    with vulnerabilities, fine-tune the model, and make it exposed to “backdoors.”
    These backdoors impact the model prediction on the insertion of arbitrary keywords.
    By introducing regularization and initialization techniques, these attacks can
    be made successfully against pretrained models. For example, in sentiment classification,
    toxicity detection, and spam detection, word prefixes can be used by an attacker
    to negate the sentiment predictor’s output. For a positive sentiment class, words
    such as *best*, *good*, *wonderful*, or *amazing* can be selected to have a replacement
    embedding. Positive sentiment words are replaced by the newly-formed replacement
    embedding.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further the attacker can also generate replacement embedding by using trigger
    words like ‘*bb*’, ‘*cf’*, and '*1346*' to change the classifier’s original result.
    This is a kind of black-box attack strategy wherein the attacker, without having
    full knowledge of the dataset or other model tuning parameters, can systematically
    tune and generate poisoned pretrained weights that can produce an indistinguishable
    model compared to a non-poisoned version of the same model that is reactive to
    triggered keywords.

- en: One mechanism of defense is to offer to check **Secure Hash Algorithm** (**SHA**)
    hash checksums (as checksums are a kind of fingerprint that helps to validate
    the model against any error such as a virus by comparing the file against the
    fingerprint) on pretrained weights. Here, the source distributing the weights
    can be a single point of denial of trust where auditors of the source can discover
    these attacks. Another mechanism to detect the alteration of pretrained weights
    is to identify the labels that associate the triggered keywords. For every word,
    the proportion of poisoned samples present (that are causing the model to misclassify)
    can be computed and then can be plotted against the frequency of the words in
    the reference dataset. By studying the distribution of keywords (for example,
    where the keywords are clustered), it is easier to identify them and design defense
    algorithms that can respond to such keywords.

    usernames are anonymized. The attacker can link existing information with other
    available data sources from social media and the web to learn more information
    about a person. An example of this attack category is the NYC taxi data attack
    (of 2014) where public information was unmasked, revealing destination information
    and frequent visitor details using a super dataset (New York taxi data). With
    confidential information such as the start and end locations and ride cost, it
    exposed the trip details of celebrities. Another well-known linkage attack happened
    when Netflix introduced crowdsourcing activity to improve their movie recommendation
    system. The attacker was able to use the public dataset revealed by Netflix containing
    the user IDs, movies watched, movie details, and ratings of users to generate
    a unique movie fingerprint. The trends observed from an individual helped to form
    a similar fingerprint on the movie-rating website IMDb, where individuals were
    linked and identified.

    the point when it gets served to customers. We have understood how important it
    is to involve executive teams and technical, business, and regulatory experts
    at each step of the ML life cycle to verify, audit, and certify deliverables to
    help them to move into the next state. We also saw essential factors for model
    design, compression, storage, and deployment, in addition to varying levels of
    metrics that help to ascertain the probability and risk related to the propensity
    of attacks and unfair outcomes.
