  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using an AI-powered solution such as Commerce.AI's Service AI, you can identify
    the product affinities and service preferences of your existing customers. This
    data can then be leveraged to create a personalized experience that caters to
    individual customers' needs and interests.

    customer information, such as demographics, past purchases history, preferred
    dining times (for example, weekend brunch), and so on, to offer late-night delivery
    services for orders placed on Fridays and early morning delivery services for
    orders placed on Mondays.

    items might be popular with people who typically dine later at night or prefer
    to have their food delivered (such as desserts). Using this information along
    with other related data points could help the restaurant better segment its customer
    base and find new market opportunities based on tailor-made offerings that meet
    people's specific needs – be they food - or non-food-related in nature.

    services. We each have different preferences about timing (early morning versus
    night), days of the week (weekend versus weekday), how much notice we need for
    an order, what delivery method is most convenient (regular mail versus courier),
    and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    store, website, app, or another purchasing medium greatly increases their chances
    of finding something that fits their needs. It also gives them a chance to see
    if there might be other options out there that they didn't know existed but would
    fit their needs better. This could be for anything from food and clothing items
    to vacations and investments – the list goes on!

    financial value. One of the top reasons for people to buy things is to define
    their social identity. It's not just a matter of self-image either – it's about
    being part of a group, which creates a sense of belonging.

    or consuming content that reflects where you live or interests you have. The key
    here is that most purchases are driven by emotions whose roots are tied to the
    customer's community. People want to feel connected in order for them to be happy
    in life – they need those connections and emotional ties.

    they'll copy others around them, whether they realize it or not. This applies
    as much to the service side as it does with all other purchases, especially those
    purchases that consumers perceive as status symbols (such as a premium airline
    membership) rather than purely functional (such as insurance). These purchases
    are often about identity more than value – they symbolize who you are.

    engage with customers, you're demonstrating that as a business, you care about
    your customers and value them enough to go above and beyond. This can lead to
    repeat customers and referrals because people trust a brand when they feel valued.

    better, and it's a great way to understand what they think about the offerings
    you provide and why. Using these findings, you can then create strategies that
    more closely align with your customers' needs and desires. In essence, AI is about
    removing constraints so that you can grow in ways that weren't possible before,

    data that your customer has already provided to you. Where possible, you should
    look at past interactions with customers and leverage that information to help
    guide future interactions. If there are any patterns that emerge from these interactions,
    it can save time and effort for both parties involved. It also helps if those
    patterns align with business goals (such as increasing sales).
  prefs:

    to understanding the context of an interaction. In many cases, today''s consumers
    are accustomed to receiving information through digital channels without having
    to actually talk with another person. As such, providing customers with information
    in an impersonal way can feel unhelpful for both sides involved. In today''s increasingly
    connected world, it is important for companies offering services, as well as their
    customers using those services, to become more familiar with each other so that

    grow is to ensure that customers are happy. There''s a lot of research showing
    that customer retention rates (that is, how long a customer remains loyal) are
    directly correlated with revenue growth. Just think about it: *If you could keep
    100% of your customers, wouldn''t that be great?*'

    your customers, if you were able to do so by continuously providing them with
    more value and enhancing existing offerings, wouldn''t that make sense?*'

    *retention* rates, would be like pouring water in a leaky bucket.

    new value for customers over time. This means that service teams need to rethink
    how they go about servicing their customers in order to create new value and grow
    revenues at the same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to creating more value for your customers, you don't always have
    to reinvent the wheel. In fact, many companies already use AI today as a means
    of enhancing their existing offerings, especially on websites such as **Airbnb**
    and **Uber**, where people are using AI features such as score sheets and driver
    ratings to figure out who might be a reliable host or driver, respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People are already engaging with these kinds of features on sites like these
    all the time; all you need is an understanding of behavioral economics (the science
    behind human decision-making). With this understanding, you can judge how best
    to deploy these tools in order for them to work optimally for your business goals
    at scale.

    items such as throw pillows. Every day, thousands upon thousands of people visit
    your e-commerce site from around the world searching for things such as `pink
    throw pillows`, or even more specific terms such as `red plaid throw pillows`.
    Data might show that customers who buy red plaid throw pillows tend to also buy
    pink throw pillows, but if a customer doesn't view either, they won't buy either.

    would show commonly bought colors in pairs?* People who searched by color would
    then be more likely to buy multiple items, thereby increasing the average cart

    of your existing inventory by understanding how people actually browse through
    it.'

    your site, you can use that data to inform future decisions about what products
    or features to include or exclude based on customer behavior. Again, using behavioral
    economics as a guide, you can create more value for customers by giving them what
    they want, when they need it most (or at least what they perceive to be the most
    useful). We call this **adaptive customization**.

    looking to create even stronger offerings and grow revenues. In fact, applying
    this same principle to social media platforms has been shown to increase user
    engagement rates significantly, which means higher retention rates and greater
    revenue growth over time.

    These platforms use data science to transform the way that businesses interact
    with their customers through their service offerings.

    to help people maintain and repair their homes. You have a great team that provides
    a high-quality service in a timely manner, but your revenue growth has stalled
    due to high customer churn.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as creating custom events for them or offering them one-on-one coaching sessions.
    To add value to your existing customers, you use Commerce.AI to analyze the sentiment
    of your reviews on **Yelp** and Angie's List, identify what questions you could
    address to improve customer satisfaction, and then use that feedback to create
    new services for your customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach has the potential to increase customer engagement while also boosting
    retention rates. For example, imagine one of your customers recently complained
    about a broken faucet in her home. You quickly created a service offering to take
    care of it along with other issues she had listed on Yelp. She was thrilled with
    the level of personalized service and appreciative that you were able to take
    care of things right away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same principles can be applied at scale for service businesses of any size.
    For example, you can use Service AI to identify your top customers and then use
    that information to create new services for them. Or, if you have a large number
    of customers in certain areas, you can use Service AI to identify which customers
    are using certain features more than others. Then, you can create new offerings
    for those users based on their needs.

    existing relationships with customers by providing more value than just transactional
    interactions, which is why we see Commerce.AI being used by leading brands such
    as **Unilever**, **Netgear**, **Coca Cola**, **Suzuki**, and many others.

    store as a place for customers to interact with each other. You could host a meetup
    or an event in your space where people can come together and learn from each other.
    Or maybe you have some interesting content that people would love to share, such
    as tips on how to be more productive at work, or how to start a business. Now
