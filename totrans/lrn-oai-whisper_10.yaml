    paper *Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision*, known as the
    *Whisper paper* ([https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf)),
    the model’s performance is strongly correlated with the volume of training data.
    About a third of Whisper’s training data is non-English, with most languages having
    less than 1,000 hours of data compared to English. This disparity limits the model’s
    potential in low-resource languages.

    languages is crucial to address the disparity in performance and improve Whisper’s
    accuracy across a broader range of languages. By actively collecting and curating
    diverse speech data from these languages, Whisper can learn and adapt to their
    unique linguistic patterns, phonemes, grammatical structures, accents, and dialects.
    This expansion of training data will boost the model’s performance, making it
    more robust, equitable, and inclusive, ensuring that the benefits of ASR technology

    learning and self-supervised pre-training can significantly boost Whisper’s performance
    in low-resource languages. Transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge gained
    from high-resource languages to improve the model’s understanding of low-resource
    languages. By identifying shared linguistic features and patterns, Whisper can
    learn and adapt to new languages more efficiently with limited supervised data.

    vast amounts of unlabeled speech data. By exposing the model to diverse speech
    samples without explicit transcriptions, it can discover inherent structures and
    representations that are transferable across languages. This unsupervised learning
    approach is precious for low-resource languages, where labeled data is scarce,
    as it allows Whisper to capture language-agnostic features and improve its overall

    across multiple languages. While the current version of Whisper already shows
    competence in punctuation, speaker diarization, and non-speech detection, further
    enhancements are needed to bridge the gap between raw speech recognition output
    and human-readable transcripts. Enhancing these capabilities is crucial for several
    reasons. First, it dramatically improves the readability and usability of transcripts
    as punctuation conveys the structure, intonation, and intended meaning of spoken
    words, making the transcript easier for human readers to follow and comprehend.
    Second, accurate speaker diarization clearly explains who said what in a conversation,
    providing essential context for the transcribed content. Finally, detecting and
    properly handling non-speech elements, such as laughter, silence, or background
    noise, contributes to a more comprehensive and nuanced audio representation. This

    and valuable for downstream tasks. One approach to achieve this is by integrating
    separate punctuation and capitalization models as a post-processing step after
    Whisper has generated the initial transcript. These models can restore punctuation
    marks such as periods, commas, question marks, and exclamation points, capitalize
    proper nouns, and begin sentences.

    individuals. Future research aims to develop advanced methods to detect interruption
    points and handle speaker overlap more effectively.
  prefs: []
