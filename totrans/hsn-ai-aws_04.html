<p class="mce-root"><span>In this section, AWS offers a plethora of managed AI services that can be leveraged by applications without the efforts to gather and clean the training data, train and tune the custom models, and host and maintain the trained models. AWS has done the heavy lifting in these AI services. You will be able to design, develop, and deploy production-ready AI solutions quickly and bring them to market with speed. We will provide you not only with an in-depth understanding of these services, but also how best to integrate with them in the AI solutions for optimal speed of experimentation, architecture flexibility, and long-term maintenance.</span></p>
