    (**ML**) adoption can open us up to powerful future opportunities. The nature
    of what we build and how we work is changing because of this massive shift in
    adoption. For most of this book, we’ve focused on AI products but we’ve also alluded
    to the various ways companies will be changing from an operational perspective
    due to AI. The best advice for companies looking to capitalize on building AI
    programs to support the products they make is to also use that same program to
    leverage AI for internal purposes. If you’re investing in this technology, you’ll
    also want to use it to make internal efficiencies and elevate the performance
    of your product.

    taking a look at what reputable consulting, research, and advisory companies have
    to say about where the greater opportunities regarding AI adoption lie, as well
    as looking into the trends coming up in adopting AI in traditional software products.

    research and trend analysis from Forrester, Gartner, and McKinsey in the following
    subsections are embedded AI, ethical AI, creative AI, and autonomous AI development.
    Embedded AI will look at AI that’s applied and integrated into the operations
    of organizations and foundations of products. Ethical AI will look at considerations
    of responsibility and privacy in AI deployment. Creative AI will look at generative
    and Web3 use cases of AI. Autonomous development will look at the growing field
    of AI-generated code. All of these are strategic growth areas for AI adoption
    according to some of the most reputable organizations we have for predicting trends.

    within a business. If your product is geared towards B2B internal processes such
    as architecture, operations, fulfillment, supply chain, HR, or procurement, you
    might be interested in bolstering your product with AI features that help companies
    fulfill their commitments to their consumers. Based on Forrester’s research on
    2022 predictions, the more your product can offer real value to your B2B consumers,
    the more you will be able to help *enterprises shrink the latency between insights,
    decisions, and results.* This area of AI that Forrester refers to as *AI Inside*
    deals with the integration of AI that’s embedded into operations. The ultimate
    goal is to help inform or even automate decision making.'

    information they can use to make high-level decisions. If your product is dependable
    in delivering this, it is worth the hassle for companies to invest in their own
    AI infrastructure to achieve the same results. Gartner outlines this concept in
    their *applications-centric AI* framework, where they consider innovations in
    engineering, decision intelligence, and operational AI systems.

    intelligence overall in order to both reduce the technical debt and visibility
    for businesses internally, as well as helping reduce the risk and unpredictability
    of outcomes. In other words, the most impactful part of this area of AI, according
    to Gartner, is that it helps decision makers have both clarity of their internal
    processes and make their most important decisions using insights that are derived
    from their own data.

    act on *“cause-and-effect relationships to go beyond correlation-based predictive
    models and toward AI systems that can prescribe actions more effectively and act
    more autonomously.”* Gartner has a number of other areas of AI implementation
    that it refers to in categories such as augmented FinOps, cybersecurity mesh architecture,
    data observability, and industry cloud platforms, all of which are areas of growth
    that support the integration of AI internally into enterprise’s business processes.
    For Gartner, this is perhaps best encapsulated by the Optimize category of their
    *Top Strategic Technology Trends* *2023* report.

    of practices and technologies that focus on optimized resilience in the face of
    threats that would impact an organization’s ability to bounce back from any threat
    to their ability to deliver a customer or user experience. As they see it, this
    would cover a wide variety of tools that help businesses prepare for potential
    risks, which learn from past failures to better prepare for the next. Rather than
    looking at this from a cybersecurity perspective, this would pertain to any internal
    process that could negatively impact experience and delivery to a customer. The
    **applied observability** category also highlights tools that are looking for
    any deviations within an organization’s operations that would impact core business

    in order to automate, add, or augment business use cases. Some of these use cases
    are defined in their report as risk management, service operations optimization,
    and product development. Based on their research, the factors contributing to
    this include the global expansion of AI adoption, more affordable AI implementation
    routes, an improvement in training speed, high growth in innovation based on patents

    AI. Thanks to advocacy groups and increasing pressure on lawmakers to define ethical
    uses of AI moving forward, the area of responsible AI is seeing a boom. AI/ML
    capabilities will go through increasing waves of regulation because of how pervasive
    AI has already become in virtually every area of human life, even in these early
    days. This opens up a lot of opportunities for products and services that already
    deal with issues of fairness, bias, and governance to then move into the area
    of governing AI bias.

    in applied AI as one of the top considerations when incorporating AI into products.
    The ability to hedge risks, particularly as AI use cases expand, is of particular
    concern. Adhering to laws, remaining vigilant on ethics, and building AI with
    social robustness are their recommendations for building in a way that mitigates
    harm. They also note that explainability is closely related to this, further highlighting
    that as models become increasingly complex and are deployed on high-risk use cases,
    the issue of explainability will remain critical.

    by Stephen Thaler. This opened up a whole new world of AI that now receives legal
    protections for its own creativity. While the same patent was rejected in the
    US, Europe, and Australia, it found a haven in South Africa. Forrester believes
    we will see an increase in legislation supporting creative outputs of AI, as well
    as an increase in creative AI patents, as these recent events are likely to change
    public perception. As AI deliverables and outputs continue to be granted legislative
    recognition, we’re likely to also see an advancement in creative tech companies

    to it as *Generative AI*, which they define as *“machine learning methods that
    learn about content or objects from their data, and use it to generate brand-new,
    completely original, realistic artifacts.”* Gartner predicts a rise in AI-augmented
    design or the use of ML and NLP to generate and develop not just creative content
    but to also *“automatically generate and develop user flows, screen designs, content,
    and presentation-layer code for digital products.”* Gartner also takes this idea
    a step further by forecasting the importance of AI-assisted immersive experiences
    as one of their top predictors for creative AI, particularly the rise of the metaverse
    and AI-driven representations that other aspects of Web3 will necessitate.

    to these as *machine learning code generation tools,* but the idea here is the
    same. These would be ML models that would work alongside human developers and
    would be integrated into development environments in order to offer suggestions
    on the code base using descriptions in natural language or fragments of code as
    a prompt. Because of the highly adaptable nature of ML to optimize repetitive
    tasks, it’s unsurprising that ML is leveraged to optimize the very way it’s built.

    needs starting to exist at scale. Those numbers are hard to predict for the consumer
    market, however, because 2022 was really the first year creative AI saw huge levels
    of adoption, with individual consumers using them for recreation.

    market for creative AI. If the current buzz around creative AI apps in the consumer
    market is any indication, we will likely see more excitement around new use cases
    and products, particularly as they integrate with other emerging technologies
    such as AR/VR, Web3, and metaverse applications.

    we’re seeing for creative AI apps. Forrester goes as far as to say that TuringBots
    will write 10% of code worldwide by the end of 2023\. Because of the rise in popularity
    of reinforcement learning and language models such as **GPT-4** (which powers
    **ChatGPT**), we’re seeing that we can take low- and no-code tools a step further
    and actually produce code with the help of AI using nothing more than basic instructions
    expressed in any natural human language. This is particularly exciting as we’re
    still in the midst of a shortage of developers, tech workers, data scientists,
    and ML engineers.

    using no- or low-code tech by 2025, which will reduce development time by 90%.
    This is great news for the build and creation process of software. The deployment
    time will be twice as fast because of continuous integration and continuous delivery
    practices, which will be helped by AI. Considering deployment is often the hardest
    part of making ML and AI use cases successful, and also brings a lot of confidence.
    37% of McKinsey’s survey participants said they would use AI/ML to test and maintain
    their existing code repositories, bringing the advantage of AI-assisted coding
    to another level.

    supporting some of the highest growth areas in AI in this current climate. Hopefully,
    this section has given you a few ideas to think about when considering bringing
    AI capabilities into the products you already manage. In the following section,
    we will talk about AI enablement, an essential component to set up before you
    get started on your journey to embrace AI and properly set it up for success.

    fully, and we’ve just spent most of this chapter looking through the various growth
    areas in AI for organizations that are already in business and are looking to
    capitalize on these growth areas. In *Part 1* of this book, we discussed the various
    layers of infrastructure that need to be supported in an AI program. In *Part
    2* of this book, we discussed the AI native product. In this current section of
    the book, we’re discussing the transition of incorporating AI into a traditional
    software product.

    like, but before we get started, we want to include a caveat. We really can’t
    talk about AI transformation unless we also set ourselves up for success to be
    able to begin the long and arduous process that is AI adoption. We have to make
    sure the conditions are right. Whether you’re working in an organization that’s
    ready to build an AI native product or you’re in a traditional software environment
    that’s ready to adopt AI at the feature level, there’s a level of expectation
    setting that’s required for the endeavor to be successful. But setting expectations
    properly in an already established software company that isn’t used to the demands
    AI will place on an organization is especially difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are both tangible and intangible challenges to building the right conditions
    for AI. The tangible ones lie with the infrastructure, the investment, and, frankly,
    the skill. Building out your team and bringing in folks that can troubleshoot
    and navigate the tricky conditions AI will force you to work in requires a special
    set of skills, and those skills are sought by virtually everyone right now. Building
    out established processes and workflows that support the various facets of an
    AI program is a formidable project that can be challenging to scope, much like
    AI projects themselves.

- en: The intangible challenges are more cerebral and emotional. In [*Chapter 7*](B18935_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219),
    we discussed the differences between traditional software products and AI-native
    products. If you recall that section, one of the biggest differences lies in the
    uncertainty AI brings. When you have an established team that’s already used to
    a certain level of expectation, it can be difficult to articulate just how much
    AI is going to change things. The uncertainty that comes with AI makes it very
    difficult to communicate the full extent of allocating a budget for teams, purchasing
    software, managing expectations of timelines and costs, and resetting boundaries
    in terms of how teams work with one another.

- en: You can’t have a fully supported AI program if your internal teams don’t have
    the right infrastructure and procedures in place. You also can’t have it if you
    do have the infrastructure and processes, but your internal teams haven’t emotionally
    internalized them yet. According to Gartner, *“By 2025, the 10% of enterprises
    that establish AI engineering best practices will generate at least three times
    more value from their AI efforts than the 90% of enterprises that do not.”* There’s
    a significant upside for companies that do their due diligence to set up their
    AI programs properly.

- en: The work of bridging the gap between the tangible and intangible challenges
    of AI is what’s referred to as AI enablement. In order for a traditional software
    product to transition into an AI product as seamlessly as possible, its leaders
    and product managers need to create a plan to make this transition successful.
    Adopting AI is a massive shift for your organization and the way it builds products.
    It’s a fundamental change to how we expect to build. Building a strong culture
    of AI enablement means that you’re preparing your teams as best as you can for
    what’s to come.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, AI enablement is really all about the data. Finding a way to most
    efficiently collect, label, and curate large amounts of unstructured data is what
    allows model performance to improve most consistently. Improving that data pipeline,
    keeping it clean, and making sure there is a steady supply of it to be used for
    training purposes is what gives the AI/ML pipeline its capabilities. Making sure
    the right data transformations are happening and the proper level of data quality
    is in place is the ultimate objective of AI enablement. This is because of the
    tremendous reliance AI has on data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best combination of AI enablement or AI readiness will come from having
    strong use cases to support your investment in AI, having strong networks of clean
    data you can leverage to support those use cases, and having a clear governance
    strategy of who can access what and how roles are delineated within your organization
    to demonstrate ownership, control, and safety measures to make sure your AI investment
    is as successful as possible. We will go into these concepts in more depth in
    the next chapter.

    some of the most reputable companies that speak about it. We looked at some of
    their insights and projections for the coming years and decades regarding AI adoption.
    Building an AI-native product is, in many ways, more straightforward than transitioning
    a product from traditional software development to an AI product.

- en: In this chapter, we wanted to set the stage and discuss some of the high-growth
    areas for AI adoption because, for many companies, knowing where to begin is often
    the hardest part. Once you’re in the flow of things, you can better anticipate
    what comes next, but when you’re at the precipice of a major paradigm shift, there’s
    a lot of friction. Going over the growth areas, data, and common use cases and
    setting the stage for AI enablement was an intuitive choice to make sure product
    managers out there are aware of what adopting AI can mean for their product. It’s
    a big responsibility and undertaking, and it should be treated as such.

    of transitioning a product to adopt AI and tangibly what that means for your product
