    across member states. Each country has regulatory bodies and procedures, which
    can lead to discrepancies in how the AI Act is enforced. For developers and companies
    operating in multiple countries, this means navigating a patchwork of regulatory
    interpretations and compliance requirements. Additionally, the resources and expertise
    available to enforce these regulations may vary significantly between countries,
    potentially leading to inconsistent application of the rules.

    are continually evolving, and the regulatory framework must be adaptable to keep
    pace with these advancements. Ensuring that regulations are flexible enough to
    accommodate new developments while maintaining rigorous standards for safety and
    ethics is a delicate balance. Regular updates to the regulatory framework and
    continuous training for enforcement personnel are necessary to address this issue.
