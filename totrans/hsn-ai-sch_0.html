<p class="mce-root"><span>With the emergence of big data and modern technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has acquired a lot of relevance in many domains. The increase in demand for automation has generated many applications for AI in fields such as robotics, predictive analytics, and finance.</span><br/>
<span>This book will give you an understanding of what AI is. It explains basic search methods in detail: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search, which can be used to make intelligent decisions when the initial state, end state, and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions can be found for such problems, but they are not optimal in terms of either space or time, and efficient approaches to space and time will be explored. We will also look at how to formulate a problem, which involves identifying its initial state, goal state, and the actions that are possible in each state. We also need to understand the data structures involved while implementing these search algorithms, because they form the basis of search exploration. Finally, we will look into what a heuristic is, because this decides the suitability of one sub-solution over another and helps you decide which step to take.</span></p>

<p><a href="3779e20a-b4b6-4e13-98ed-197fbaff0977.xhtml">Chapter 3</a><em>, Understanding the Heuristic Search Algorithm</em><span>, takes you through the priority queue data structure and explains how to visualize search trees. The chapter also covers problems related to greedy best-first search, and how A* solves that problem.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "T<span>he </span><kbd>State</kbd><span> class has to be changed for every application, even though the search algorithm is the same</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>def checkGoalState(self):<br/>        """<br/>        This method checks whether the person is Jill.<br/>        """ <br/>        #check if the person's name is Jill<br/>        return self.name == "Jill"</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>#create a dictionary with all the mappings<br/>connections = {}<br/>connections["Dev"] = {"Ali", "Seth", "Tom"}<br/>connections["Ali"] = {"Dev", "Seth", "Ram"}<br/>connections["Seth"] = {"Ali", "Tom", "Harry"}<br/><strong>connections["Tom"] = {"Dev", "Seth", "Kai", 'Jill'}</strong><br/>connections["Ram"] = {"Ali", "Jill"}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ pip install pydot</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
