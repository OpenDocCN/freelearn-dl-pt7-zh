    AI adoption in existing products. Every product will be different and every product
    owner will come to their own conclusions about what level of AI adoption to infuse
    into their product. For some products, something as simple as adding one AI feature
    is enough. For other products, a fundamental change to the underlying logic that
    powers your product might be required. The decisions of how to transform your
    product should, first and foremost, be determined by your product strategy and
    should serve your overarching company vision. These decisions should be collaborative
    and should come with a high level of executive sponsorship.

    supports the evolution of your product. We will look at how to approach brainstorming
    about your AI options, which considerations will be most important as you brainstorm,
    how to evaluate your product’s performance within the competitive landscape, how
    to build a product strategy that sets you up for success, and ultimately which
    signposts and milestones will help you build confidence and which will indicate
    that you need to go back to the drawing board.

    important part of your AI product strategy journey. As you continue this exercise,
    you’ll go through a spectrum. You’ll start with a really open-ended, right-brain
    brainstorming session on the cerebral notion of value and how your product can

    require more of an investment from the company to complete. Understanding the
    variety in terms of effort is most important from a planning and resource management
    perspective. If certain features need to be built, and they do require a lot of

    Defining success will be a collaborative act and it’s important for product managers
    of AI products to bring in all major stakeholders of the company to align on defining
    that success. If the product evolution into AI doesn’t include the voices of your
    go-to-market, sales, marketing, strategy, engineering, and leadership teams, it
    won’t have the appropriate level of sponsorship it will need to truly be effective,
    funded, and evangelized about internally and externally.

    of your product will also not be tied to your most important business objectives
    at the organizational level. Building the right level of data fluency with these
    teams and using data to support your claims about the direction your product is
    taking is non-negotiable. Be patient with yourself, your organization, and your
    technical talent on data. Data is the whole thing. It’s what powers this entire
    endeavor we’re discussing. Don’t give in to the pressure to rush things. There
    are always business imperatives to get to market as quickly as possible. The instinct
    to just start and build as you go will always be something product managers and
    leaders alike will have to push against, but don’t rush this.

    Think about what the limitations are, and what opportunities, strengths, and challenges
    the old version of your product offered your customers. How can you capitalize

    teams later down the line, but at this stage, it’s a bit too soon for that. Try
    to analyze your competition from the lens of the original value list we started
    out with. That value list shouldn’t just be a list of features you want to add
    to your product. It should be a summary of the types of value your product offers
    its users and customers. Features are descriptive and matter-of-fact. Values are
    closely tied to worth.

    will be competing with. Try and get a sense of whether or not the products in
    your competitive landscape offer the same level of value to your market or not.

    gone to market with their own AI features or upgrades, is to understand how those

    help you get to this point in the process. Now that you’ve gotten to this point,
    you’re going to spread the word and get feedback from the rest of the organization

- en: As the AI product manager, you’ll want to be aware of the potential hurdles
    to look out for, as well as the indicators that your AI adoption is going well.
    Your organization will be looking to your leadership as this journey unfolds.
    Your credibility in this area will be cemented if you can be a safe haven for
    your colleagues when things go wrong and a source of encouragement when things
    seem to be going wrong but aren’t.

    an existing product into an AI product. So much of this chapter has been about
    how to anticipate and prepare for the jump to AI/ML. In the second section of
    the book, we heavily discussed concepts related to the AI-native product: a product
    that’s created with AI initially. Once you do make the jump to fully embracing
    AI in your own product, you can refer to *Part 2* of this book, which is more
    focused on the aspects that come up when you’re in the flow of building AI. In
    this section, we wanted to focus on the preparation stages for embracing AI/ML
    because of the gravity that comes with AI transformation.'

    your data right, evaluating the competitive landscape you’ll be playing in, and
    bringing in your stakeholders to make a plan for how to build the transition are
    all part of AI readiness. All of the ideas expressed in this chapter are also
    easier said than done and each section of this chapter will be a process in and
    of itself, but once you are able to get to the point where you’ve decided on a
    product strategy and you’re executing that strategy with a product roadmap that
    your entire organization can get behind, you’re on your way to building with AI.

- en: It’s a privilege and a massive responsibility to be a product manager, particularly
    one that oversees the AI transformation of their product. It’s an exciting time
    in your product management career and one that you’ll likely look back on fondly.
    We’re at a unique precipice in history and not many product managers can say they
    were able to be of service in such a big step for their organizations and their
    respective products. As you hit difficult moments along this journey, remind yourself
    that this is a difficult transformation to manage and evangelize for others in
    your organization too.

    heart and if you find yourself getting frustrated, it’s actually a great sign.
    It means you care enough about your product and your organization’s success with
    AI to elicit an emotional reaction. Give yourself and your co-creators grace and
    be proud of the work you’re all doing collectively to embrace the wave of AI.
