- en: Remodeling your outlook on banking begins with keeping up to date with the latest
    and most effective approaches, such as **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**). *Hands-On
    Artificial Intelligence for Banking* is a practical guide that will help you advance
    in your career in the banking domain. The book will demonstrate AI implementations
    to make your banking services smoother, more cost-efficient, and accessible to
    clients, focusing on both the client- and server-side uses of AI.

    into the recent AI revolution in the banking industry. Next, you'll get hands-on
    machine learning experience, exploring how to use time series analysis and reinforcement
    learning to automate client procurements and banking and finance decisions. After
    this, you'll progress to learning about mechanizing capital market decisions,
    using automated portfolio management systems, and predicting the future of investment
    banking. In addition to this, you'll explore concepts such as building personal
    wealth advisors and the mass customization of client lifetime wealth. Finally,
    you'll get to grips with some real-world AI considerations in the field of banking.

- en: '**Students** in banking or technologies are the target audience for the book
    as there is a vacuum in the publication space regarding how AI technologies are
    used in the banking and finance industry. This book aims to give a reasonably
    useful list of use cases commonly known in the public domain and provide real
    sample code that is easy to implement. With this book, I am trying to expound
    important use cases but not to give you a machine learning model that you can
    put in use the next day.'

- en: For **bankers** who are already in the field, I'm sure this book will help you
    build your services in the long run. It may encourage you to challenge anything
    that is obviously different from the way a start-up would function if you were
    ever to start one. Changes need to be made inside-out and outside-in. For IT managers
    within banks, this will give you a concrete code base on how the technologies
    can be applied and which open source libraries are available. Perhaps you are
    not convinced about developing everything in-house for production purposes. This
    book serves as a code base for any experiments you wish to launch.

    Your job is instrumental in the adoption of AI in banking—while at the same time,

    in AI more effective and efficient. The best way to do that is to have hands-on
    knowledge about technology. If the company/investment project is just copying
    and pasting code along with a fancy renowned school name, just ignore that and
    spend your energy somewhere better.
