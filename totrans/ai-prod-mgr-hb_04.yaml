    we’re seeing many use cases of AI proliferating across industries. In our work
    managing AI products, we’ve certainly relied on AI consultants and PhD-level advisors
    to help us with modeling and orchestrating our data strategy to support a full-scale
    AI operation. However, as the rising tidal wave of AI continues to penetrate various
    companies and use cases, we’re seeing less of a reliance on breakthroughs achieved
    through advanced degrees. What’s most important now is familiarity with the use
    of even simple, reliable models. There’s a time and place for specialization.
    Data science and AI are massive umbrella terms but, based on my experiences as
    a product manager, I see a real need for data and AI generalists that can understand
    the use cases themselves and how they relate to a business perspective.

    because the data wasn’t as abundant as it is now. Now that data is abundant, we’re
    seeing a profound shift. Instead of the focus being on researching and discovering
    the most leading-edge algorithms to choose in the first place, the focus is now
    on acquiring enough talent to use the tried and true models and algorithms. What
    we particularly like about this is the concept of AI democratization, or the idea
    that AI is becoming accessible to more groups of people outside research and MAANG
    companies.

    ask. Some product managers believe that the way to create the best product is
    to conduct your own breakthrough research from an AI perspective. Other product
    managers believe you can actually get a lot done with models that have become
    commonplace or have been around a long time, such as regression models.

    gravitate first toward use cases that can be profitable and allow for research
    and optimization. Because B2B products are products that are made for and used
    by other businesses, their use case is oriented completely toward the business
    world. This impacts everything from how they’re marketed to how they’re bought,
    sold, used, and negotiated. So many B2B products speak to the business impact
    that a product can satisfy for a customer across multiple levels. It’s a great
    way to learn potentially helpful applications of AI.

    data to train on. Specifically, one of the ethical challenges with this expansion
    in data and AI products is being able to offer large amounts of data without leaking
    information that can identify you as a person, also known as **private personal
    information** (**PPI**). Hazy, a UK-based AI company, offers its customers just
    that: the ability to derive insights, understand signals, and share data using
    what’s called synthetic data. Synthetic data is data that mimics real-world scenarios
    but is created in virtual worlds, and what it’s mimicking is the statistical similarity
    with real-world datasets. Because of the nature of data-hungry deep learning models,
    synthetic data is preferred when training neural networks and because of that,
    Hazy has a bright future ahead of itself. The company’s done a lot with its modest
    $3M in funding and has added a number of marquee customers to its roster in a
    short time.'

    for the businesses it supports, and though we’re firmly in the data-rich era of
    big data, machine learning and deep learning still require massive volumes of
    data to learn and retrain from regularly. Hazy has done a fantastic job of alleviating
    businesses’ pain points when it comes to data availability, and it’s evident in
    the loyalty of their customer base. Another way Hazy maintains this loyalty is
    by educating its customers on the ethical and legal ramifications of traditional
    ways of anonymizing or masking existing real-world data.

    is a California-based gaming company called GGWP. While they don’t create their
    own games, they use AI to reduce toxicity in the gaming culture and provide gaming
    companies with a dashboard where they can see how their users are performing from
    a moderation perspective. As gaming companies consistently take a more serious
    look at the safety and health of their gaming communities, they will come to rely
    on companies such as GGWP to ensure all their users feel safe. Moderation has
    long been a topic of discussion in social media companies and gaming companies
    alike, and it’s really nice to find an AI company finding success in this field.
  prefs: []

    AI over human workers in specific fields. The biggest issue in employing human
    moderators is first and foremost the emotional toll it takes on their mental health
    as they go about their day. Scanning for hurtful or violent language isn’t for
    the faint of heart, and finding depictions of graphic or hateful content on a
    consistent basis can deflate even the strongest of us. There’s a strong case to
    be made for the ethical use of AI in helping us tackle the problems we, as human
    beings, would rather not be tasked with.

    businesses in the B2B world, there’s a standard operating procedure most businesses
    are comfortable with following. This includes everything from sales tactics to
    the approvals of budgets or statements of work to getting contracts approved through
    leadership, procurement, and all stakeholder teams in between. Because most B2B
    products are concerned with cost saving, productivity, or revenue generation,
    there are more structured interactions between all the players involved. The spirit
    of a professional is competence and integrity, no matter what arises in the moment,
    and B2B markets can be thought of in many ways as well-oiled machines. Much like
    the products they represent, these companies themselves are looking for ways to
    optimize productivity, generate revenue, and lower costs in their sales cycles
    and market interactions.

    expression for potentially billions of unmet customers. B2C refers to products
    that are built with the expectation that the product will be bought and used by
    individual consumers rather than other businesses. With B2C products, there’s
    a feeling that you’re looking for a way to satisfy the needs and tastes of many
    individuals. Upon further reflection, B2C companies are looking to satisfy the
    few common collective needs of millions. The more due diligence that goes into
    imagining solutions and understanding unmet needs that would help so many people,
    the more prepared these companies will be to satisfy unmet needs.

    and varying energies coming from the social collective. It aligns pretty nicely
    with the idea of the invisible hand of the market. The concept of product-market
    fit is nebulous as well. The market wants what it wants and we all make up the
    market directly or indirectly, and the companies that create true art meet the
    market where it is. It’s no wonder people are interested in learning languages.
    The world is increasingly global. The global job market supports people all over

    Consumers are different from those working with other businesses. There isn’t
    an entire village of potential gatekeepers getting in the way of finding an able
    and willing sale. When selling a product to consumers, you’ve just got to win
    over one consciousness. You’d be tempted to be all things to all people in a way.
    We would imagine it would be hard to select and prioritize features. Catering
    your product to potentially millions of viewpoints would be unsustainable. But
    capturing an emotional need that would inspire and engage millions of viewers
    would ring like a bell, and everyone that hears its echo would feel its radiance.

    of a pandemic that has exacerbated the issues of an already strained supply chain
    crisis, we really loved the idea of a deep learning platform that was looking
    to not just streamline supply chain routes but also looking to solve the problem
    of maritime fuel consumption. We still find it shocking that we are so reliant
    on physically moving goods such large distances, and that labor costs and raw
    material availability fuel this highly inefficient global trade system we’ve built.
    We hope that, one day, we can create more efficient localized systems for managing
    global consumption, but in the meantime, there’s Bearing.

    much competition. A Google search for deep learning maritime route optimization
    products produced very few results, and this is the heart of the blue ocean landscape.
    You’re not clamoring and infighting with your competitors for customers. The inherent
    challenge with blue oceans is that you have to create demand and justify the existence
    of your product. You have to essentially create a compelling story for why you
    should be in business, and why the world needs your product. It’s a tricky game
    but if you do it well, you get your pick of customers. Right now, Bearing is in
    closed beta for a select group of customers. This is another advantage of the
    blue ocean: you can create an air of exclusivity. Only certain special ones get
    to know about this new, exciting venture.'

    explainability. This is something that becomes more or less important to the success
    of a product based on the use case. With Bearing, the deep learning models are
    optimizing for the best routes, and for the company and its customers, the accuracy
    of the models is more important than their explainability. If it works, it works.
    Here, we see less of a reliance on explaining how the models come to certain conclusions
    because their customers are more concerned with whether the routes make sense
    and are indeed more efficient, and less concerned with how the inner mechanics
    are arriving at certain conclusions. This might not be the case if it were, say,
    a dating site or a property tech company optimizing costs for renters.

    a responsible and ethical way. There aren’t many companies doing this, and Fiddler
    allows you the ability to adhere to regulations and build models into your product
    at every stage of their life cycle. Fiddler does a great job of justifying itself:
    by bringing up the very real risks that might impact every company that’s creating
    an environment for using machine learning models. They also do a great job of
    evangelizing their product. From the World Economic Forum, to Forbes, to CB Insights

    difficult to navigate because you are creating demand for a product and, in essence,

    this kind of market is something very few people can sustain for very long. The

    in a highly crowded marketplace. With so many competitors, you can easily get
    distracted and burnt out. Every competitor represents a potential direction in
    which you can grow your product. Other opportunities can be elusive if you’re
    focused enough, and companies that try to be all things to all people suffer from
    this lack of focus. Product managers and leadership will need to work together
    to ensure there is a clear vision for the product and that the company can rally
    behind that vision as a team. To us, rebels are fearless, and exploring this fear
    could be helpful to understand successful companies found in red oceans. Perhaps
    the fearlessness comes from the practiced courage of a company that’s consistently
    facing so many adversaries in the market. Eventually, you sweat the small stuff
    and you gain the gift of having laser-focused vision.

    is referred to as a dominant strategy because it’s a winner-takes-all mentality.
    Let’s take an example such as fast fashion, a highly competitive market if we’ve
    ever seen one. If you’re a fast fashion retailer, it’s not only important to have
    a cheaper product, but you must have operations to support the delivery of that
    product more efficiently. Think Netflix, a good example in its heyday, but today
    we struggle to find a better example than SHEIN. The Chinese brand manifests its
    dominant strategy by leveraging AI to better anticipate new trends and predict
    demand for certain products in the market and it marries that data with its supply
    chain to ensure that it can deliver on changes in demand to its customers’ delight.

    regard to how they ask for and use a product. This change in paradigm offers the
    entire market the gift of novelty and specialization. Maybe the job gets done
    worse, but this is beneficial for a new group of proposed customers. Perhaps this
    new group is one none of the other competitors thought to try and serve.

    in some niche but you’re also charging more for it to account for this specialization.
    My differentiated strategy example is a company that hits close to home: a British
    machine learning based property tech company I worked with named Beekin. Beekin
    isn’t a property technology platform that was cheaper per se, but, at the time,
    it offered a next-generation platform no other property tech company was able
    to offer. We built a machine learning native platform that did everything from
    making market evaluations to predicting future behaviors to offer an optimal price
    for renters. Our customers didn’t have many options for competing tools because
    their alternatives were property tech giants with antiquated rule-based engines,
    and the competitive landscape in property tech is newly being disrupted by AI.'

    the strength of their products. Because the price tag is also higher, there needs
    to be a compelling reason why someone would pursue differentiators in a market.
    Unique products that differ greatly from their competitors thrive in this market
    strategy. In the case of Beekin, there weren’t many other competitors using machine
    learning as the foundation of their product, and it was able to help many people
    with their jobs to be done. This is the greatest strength of a differentiated
    product: to satisfy a niche and advancing market. The need for differentiation
    is what furthers and matures industries. Once customers with more particular and
    pressing needs arise, differentiators pop up to show their competitors how they
    might begin specializing and rising to meet their customers where they are.'

    seen so far. The work and dedication that it takes to align a viable functioning
    product with a business model, a product strategy, and a loyal customer base is
    nothing short of a triumph, and success should be shouted out and celebrated.
    We learn so much from the successes of others and we had a lot of fun choosing
    fitting examples for this chapter.

    you can easily explain your AI product, how it comes to certain conclusions, and
    how the inner mechanics of how it works becomes very important when you’re dealing
    with the public or sensitive subject matter, or if you have high-profile or enterprise
    customers that may be subject to risk later downstream. We don’t want to convince
    you of what kind of product manager you should be; rather, we want to lay down
    the options for you to consider.

    of a machine learning intern just out of bootcamp, know that a lot can be done
    with very simple models. Striving for algorithmic perfection and relying on simple
    tools that are commonly relied on and used are equally admirable. It’s largely
    a question of preference and use case.

    products in recent years to offer a variety of perspectives on how AI can be leveraged
    across a number of different business models. This isn’t about emulating other
    companies but rather coming to appreciate how AI philosophy, behaviors, ethics,
    and practices can change from one business model to another. For us, this is vital
    to how the product is managed at the department level. As a product manager, you
    are tasked with the commercial success of the product, and understanding how AI
    relates to your business model is important to your risk management.

    years for the purposes of finding inspiration in the successes and use cases of
    our peers in the space. As a product manager, having an understanding of your
    go-to-market strategy, business model, and the market you serve is crucial. We
    are firmly in the era of AI proliferation now. Many businesses are adopting AI
    within their products and within their businesses, and we hope you’ve enjoyed
    these examples as we continue to understand the particulars of managing an AI
    product.

    what the emerging trends on the horizon in AI are. We believe all product managers
    need to have a streak of futurism in their composition. Having a grasp of where
    things are in the recent and present moments provides a snapshot with which to
    evaluate your existing strategy. But in tech, things evolve pretty quickly. In
    business, projections and future goals can change from week to week as well.
