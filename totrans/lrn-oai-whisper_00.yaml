    try to secure a decent GPU for our Colab! Unfortunately, accessing a good GPU
    with the free version of Google Colab (i.e., Tesla T4 16 GB) is becoming much
    harder. However, with Google Colab Pro, we should have no issues in being allocated
    a V100 or P100 GPU.

    playback. A microphone and speakers connected to your computer might help you
    experience the interactive voice features. Another option is to open the URL link
    Gradio provides at runtime on your mobile phone; from there, you might be able
    to use the phone’s microphone to record your voice.
