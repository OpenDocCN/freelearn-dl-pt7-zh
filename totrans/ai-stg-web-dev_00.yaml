- en: My journey in technology began at 14, as the internet became popular, sparking
    a lifelong commitment to innovation and anticipation of global demands. This path
    has led me to pivotal roles, such as managing the portfolio of technology and
    infrastructure projects for public security at the Rio 2016 Olympics, managing
    the portfolio of programs and projects for strategic initiatives, including the
    AI program at Brazil’s Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, and the
    national directorate of large-scale educational assessments in Brazil. This journey,
    marked by roles in IT governance, digital law, AI product management, machine
    learning engineering, internal audit, project management, and business strategies,
    underscores my commitment to leveraging AI for societal benefit. Today, I am honored
    to serve as a board member of the Global Centre for Risk and Innovation and represent
    Brazil as an innovation expert at the G20\. These experiences have prepared me
    to contribute to the future of AI in web development, ensuring that this technology
    serves as a force for social good and innovation.
