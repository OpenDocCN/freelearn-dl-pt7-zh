    programming. You will be introduced to the classic coin-change problem as an application
    of dynamic programming. Furthermore, you will learn how to implement policy evaluation,
    policy iteration, and value iteration and learn the differences between them.
    By the end of the chapter, you will be able to implement dynamic programming to
    solve problems in **Reinforcement Learning** (**RL**).

    also learned how to implement custom environments, depending on the application.
    You also learned the basics of TensorFlow 2, how to implement a policy using the
    TensorFlow 2 framework, and how to visualize learning using TensorBoard. In this
    chapter, we will see how **Dynamic Programming** (**DP**) works in general, from
    a computer science perspective. Then, we'll go over how and why it is used in
    RL. Next, we will dive deep into classic DP algorithms such as policy evaluation,
    policy iteration, and value iteration and compare them. Lastly, we will implement
    the algorithms in the classic coin-change problem.

    Furthermore, RL algorithms such as **Value Iteration**, **Policy Iteration**,
    and others, as we will see, use the same basic principle: avoid repeated computations
    to save time, which is what DP is all about. The philosophy of DP is not new;
    it is self-evident and commonplace once you learn the ways to solve it. The hard
    part is identifying whether a problem can be solved using DP.'

    number of candies in a box. If you know there are 100 candies in a box, and the
    shopkeeper offers 5 extra candies, you don''t start counting the candies all over
    again. You use the prior information to add 5 to the original count and say, "I
    have 105 candies." That''s the core of DP: saving intermediate information and
    reusing it, if required, to avoid re-computation. While it sounds simple, as mentioned
    before, the hard part is identifying whether a problem can be solved using DP.
    As we will see later, in the *Identifying Dynamic Programming Problems* section,
    a problem must satisfy a specific prerequisite, such as optimal substructure and
    overlapping subproblems, to be solved using DP, which we will study in the *Identifying
    Dynamic Programming Problems* section. Once a problem qualifies, there are some
    well-known techniques such as top-down memoization, that is, saving intermediate
    states in an unordered fashion, and bottom-up tabulation, which is saving the
    states in an ordered array or matrix.'

- en: Combining these techniques can achieve a considerable performance boost over
    solving them using brute force. Furthermore, the difference in time increases
    with an increase in the number of operations. Mathematically speaking, solutions
    solved using DP usually run in O(n2), while those using brute force execute in
    O(2n) time, where the notation "O" (Big-O) can be loosely thought of as the number
    of operations performed. So, for instance, if N=500, which is a reasonably small
    number, a DP algorithm will roughly execute 5002 steps, compared to a brute force
    algorithm, which will use 2500 steps. For reference, there are 280 hydrogen atoms
    in the sun, which is undoubtedly a much smaller number than 2500.

    all other costs are fixed, and the highest price offered for your product is the
    only indicator of profits earned, which is a fair assumption for most business
    cases. So, naturally, you''d wish to sell all your cakes to the shop offering
    the highest price, but there''s a decision to make as there are multiple shops
    that offer different prices on different sizes of cakes. So, you have two choices:
    how much to sell, and which shop to trade with. For this example, we''ll forget
    other variables and assume there are no additional hidden costs. We''ll tackle
    the problem using the tabular method, as well as memoization.'

    side, for instance, becomes one part of the cake, and the right side can be treated
    as an independent partition. In the next iteration, we''ll only concentrate on
    the right side / the other part. Now, again, we can partition it, and the right

    best path from A to C, then the best route from A to D will include the path from
    A to C. This is called the optimal substructure. Essentially, what it means is
    the optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
    Remember how we didn''t care to recalculate the best profit for a cake of size
    `n` once we knew it? Because we know the best profit for the cake of size `n +
    1` will include `n` while considering making a cut and dividing the cake into
    size `n` and `1`. To reiterate, the property of optimal substructure would be
    a requirement if we were to solve the problem using DP.'

    repeatedly: the optimal solution for size three would call for size two and then
    one. Then, for size 4, it would again call for three, and then two, and then one.
    This recursive re-computation is due to the nature of the problem: the overlapping
    subproblems. This is the reason we could save the answer in a memo and later use
    the same solution without recomputing it. The overlapping subproblem is another

    A finite set of actions, *A*, gives the action space, and a finite set of rewards,

    mapping between state *S* and action *A*, for instance, a choice a robot would
    make such as go left or right. And a deterministic policy allows us to choose
    an action in a non-random fashion (as opposed to a stochastic policy, which has
    a significant random component).

    stochastic policy, however, would say: if here''s a hole in the ground, take a
    left turn with 80% probability, which means there''s a small chance that the car
    would purposely enter the hole. While this move might not make sense at the moment,
    we will see later, in the *Chapter 7, Temporal Difference Learning*, that this

    DP problems. The first method, memoization, also called the top-bottom method
    uses a dictionary (or HashMap-like structure) to store intermediate results in
    a natural (unordered) manner. While the second method, the tabular method, also
    called the bottom-up method, sequentially solves problems from small to large
    and usually saves the result in a matrix-like structure.
