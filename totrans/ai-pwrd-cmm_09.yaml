    the end goal is to become (or to stay) highly profitable, this starts with matching
    the break-even point. While profitability is a universal challenge for businesses,
    this is particularly true for the restaurant industry, which faces notoriously
    slim profit margins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is estimated that the average profit margin of a restaurant is approximately
    3% to 5%, with many restaurants struggling to break even. This has led some to
    call the restaurant industry a *low-profit* business. So, what does it take to
    generate enough revenue to break even? And more importantly, how can you increase
    your revenues in order to achieve profitability?

    in order to bring them back into your business on a recurring basis.

    the pricing structure of your business – and more specifically, the *why* behind
    what you are charging for your products or services. If you are currently charging
    too little for your offerings, then the chances are that this is resulting in
    lost revenue and a decreased overall bottom line.

    offer, then they probably won't be returning for future purchases – no matter
    how good those previous purchases were. You can increase profits by raising prices
    on selected items that are in high demand while simultaneously lowering prices
    on other items that may not be as highly sought after. This will help ensure that
    the balance between the sales volume and average ticket price remains favorable
    over time.

    by competitors (or possibly even by yourself in the past) as well as any tax implications
    associated with any such changes. There may be opportunities here to further increase
    profitability based on tax laws or certain government incentives currently in
    place. Most importantly, however, is analyzing pricing and demand data at scale
    to calculate the optimal pricing strategy.

    of years, and while innovations such as augmented reality have brought new excitement
    and appeal to dining out, we believe that consumers are looking for more than

    years ago, the focus was on aspects such as the taste of the meal, the variety

    For example, there's a new reality of smaller dine-in sales overall, as well as
    decreased check sizes. As a result, restaurants have to look for new ways to bring
    in revenue, in addition to satisfying customers based on their new preferences.
    For example, restaurants can consider changing their menu or even implementing
    technology to better help them adhere to social distancing protocols (for example,
    contactless payment options and QR codes for menus).

    an important role in determining whether an experience will be memorable or not,
    and whether guests will want to share it with others or not (hence why engagement
    metrics on social media become so important).

    in their businesses.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will perform in-market. By analyzing the performance of food items in the restaurant
    industry at large, restaurateurs can identify which food items are likely to be
    most popular with consumers. This information can then be used to inform business
    decisions about menu items, pricing, and marketing campaigns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, restaurants would rely on their experience to make business decisions.
    However, with more data to hand, restaurateurs can use data science to gain insights
    into how customers are likely to respond to food items. For instance, a restaurant
    might use Commerce.AI to automatically monitor social media sentiment surrounding
    its dishes and adjust its menu accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the last few years, we've seen increased investment in data science and AI
    across a wide variety of industries. However, in the restaurant industry, the
    use of these tools has been relatively slow to develop. The main reasons for this
    are that it is difficult to predict how individual consumers will respond to new
    trends or innovations in real-time and that it is costly and inefficient for restaurants
    to collect large amounts of consumer data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    both of these challenges. And as a result, more and more restaurants are starting

    with popular third-party services such as **Google** **Analytics** and **Facebook**
    **Insights**, two widely used tools when measuring customer engagement with online
    businesses. These integration capabilities let you analyze customer sentiments
    using the same data sources that you use for your marketing analytics programs,
    which means you can begin making smarter decisions about how to build your business
    from day one, instead of building it after the fact based on feedback from existing

    Companies are engaging with their followers on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and
    other platforms in real time so they can learn what matters most to them as consumers.
    This knowledge helps brands make smarter decisions about their products and services,
    grow sales, improve customer loyalty programs through personalized offers, and

    a great way to stay connected with your customers. This means that you can hear
    about any emerging issues before anyone else does and respond quickly when something
    goes wrong or needs fixing. It's also a great way to get alerts when potential
    new customers show interest in your brand or product category.

    It means measuring the benefits of social media campaigns, whether it be through
    likes, comments, shares, or other interactions on your company's social platforms.
    With social media as a platform for customer engagement, brands can listen in
    on what their customers are saying and learn from their feedback.

    from customers using social channels such as **Facebook** **Live** or **YouTube**
    **Chats**, you should be able to track how many people watch the live stream and
    interact with the content. A similar approach can be taken when listening to comments
    that customers leave on your website or blog posts. By tracking comment data,
    you can see who is engaging with your brand and what they are saying about your
    company and products.

    such as Commerce.AI to stay connected with customers across multiple channels
    so they can understand what types of content resonate most with them and why.
    This allows companies to create targeted content marketing campaigns that keep
    their audiences engaged and ultimately drive more revenue for their businesses.
