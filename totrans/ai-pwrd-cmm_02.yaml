    seemed to end with an apocalyptic prediction. In 2014, Elon Musk said that, with
    AI, we are *summoning the demon*, while Stephen Hawking said that AI *could spell
    the end of the human race*. More recently, however, things have begun to change.
    AI has gone from being a scary black box to something people can use for a variety
    of use cases.

    including by product teams for market opportunity identification. AI hasn't always
    been used in the industry. In fact, it started out as a scientific curiosity.
    In the 1950s, computer scientist John McCarthy wanted to see whether it was possible
    to build machines that could learn how to do tasks such as play chess themselves.
    Today, AI is everywhere.

    an unmet need. It helps them find out how their product will stand out in the
    market and what they need to do in order to grow. They need to identify the competitive
    landscape, define the market opportunity, and use this to create a value proposition.

    failure. Belief in a market opportunity is not enough – there needs to be hard
    data. Market opportunity identification is the process of acquiring and analyzing
    data, from any source, to understand the potential size of a market and the potential
    share of that market that you can capture.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the most effective ways to find out what customers want and how much they are
    willing to spend for it. This not only gives a company an idea of what to produce
    but also helps figure out how much money they will make from their products.

    techniques** such as the *5 Whys* technique. The 5 Whys technique is simple and
    can be used as a brainstorming exercise by asking *why?* five times in response
    to a topic, problem, or issue.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data** such as surveys and interviews that have already been done before. Often,
    large companies will have a lot of unorganized, unstructured information that
    is divided across departments and projects, from Google Surveys to JotForm to
    SurveyMonkey. When this data is analyzed, they may find opportunities they weren't
    aware of before.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    external data** and data from social media platforms or competitors in the same
    industry. This includes sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook where both companies'
    and individuals' data can prove valuable.

    which allows people to examine the search volume in a particular area of interest
    over a certain period of time. For example, if you were interested in finding
    out about the popularity of rooftop gardens in Los Angeles, you could type into
    Google Trends *Los Angeles Rooftop Gardens*, and analyze search trends over time.
    Additionally, Google Trends lets you easily export this data for further analysis,
    whether it's to create visualizations or merge with additional data.

    consider the decision to either pursue or ignore them. If the company chooses
    to pursue an external, internal, or potential market, then it needs to consider
    which approach is best.

    in a sea of unrelated variables**. For example, using traditional **business intelligence**
    (**BI**) techniques such as data munging and manual data mining, it might take
    weeks or even months to discover a predictive pattern in a large database of customer
    survey results. Imagine that your dataset includes demographics, firmographics,
    psychographics, purchase data, reviews, and more. That's a lot of information
    to look through, and a lot of variables that might not seem relevant at first
    glance.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    discovery of predictive patterns when analyzing big data**, which is increasing
    in volume at a faster pace than traditional databases are being updated. Not only
    does this make it difficult to keep up with the latest insights, but it also becomes
    more costly and time-consuming to build insights into existing systems.

    of computing power and virtually unlimited storage thanks to their substantial
    investments in hardware and software services, but for smaller organizations –
    even those that are eager to harness the potential of big data – the story is
    different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data is coming in faster than ever before. The explosion of data being generated
    has outpaced the capabilities of traditional database systems to keep up with
    growth, but setting up and maintaining systems such as AWS or GCP requires dedicated
    engineers, given the requirements for technical know-how on scaling, security,
    data pipelines, and more.

    with AI is that it is not about creating a *magic wand* that will instantly identify
    all of the major new market opportunities. That would be a data scientist's or
