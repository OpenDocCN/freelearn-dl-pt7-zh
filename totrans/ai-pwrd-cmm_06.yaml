    development particularly tough. There's a far smaller, more exclusive market of
    people to target, and traditional methods of market research, such as focus groups,
    fall short in luxury markets, which are largely made up of **high-net-worth individuals**
    (**HNWIs**).

    so analyzing brand data is of special importance. At the same time, luxury brands
    naturally have far fewer customers than mass-market brands, which means that getting
    that data through normal means proves to be a real challenge.

    they command higher margins than mass-market rivals due to higher brand equity.

    beautiful clothing or jewelry that is designed to convey a desirable image for
    consumers (and hence, raise brand equity).'

    The typical consumer perceives luxury goods as just above their budget range but

    the products are expensive, but that they also have a reputation for being ostentatious
    and frivolous. That means luxury brands must walk a fine line between appearing
    exclusive and appearing tacky. And it's not easy, with many luxury socks, for
    instance, costing thousands of dollars.

    mass counterparts on social media. For example, they tend to have more sophisticated
    strategies for managing their online reputations and building relationships with

    don't, allowing them to personalize marketing campaigns and engage with customers
    in new ways.

    and **zipper**. The **zipper** attribute is highlighted as a non-obvious trend,

    products. By highlighting popular attributes, AI can help product teams focus
