    such as version control and **continuous integration/continuous deployment** (**CI/CD**)
    to infrastructure automation, is revolutionizing how we manage and operate software
    systems. By treating infrastructure configuration with the same rigor as application
    code, GitOps promotes significant improvements in automation, predictability,

    for configuring and deploying systems, which can lead to inconsistencies and human
    errors. This manual approach often results in environments that vary between development,
    testing, and production, making it difficult to ensure reliability and predictability.
    Additionally, changes in traditional setups are rarely version-controlled, meaning
    there’s no straightforward way to track modifications or revert to previous states
    if an issue arises. Recovery from failures is often slow and cumbersome, requiring
    significant manual intervention.'

    development practices such as version control and CI/CD to infrastructure operations.
    With GitOps, all infrastructure configurations are treated as code and stored
    in Git repositories, providing a clear history of changes and the ability to roll
    back to known good states easily. This approach ensures consistency across all
    environments, as the same code that defines the infrastructure is used for development,
    testing, and production. Automated deployment processes reduce manual errors and
    enhance efficiency, while built-in security features of version control systems
    such as Git enhance overall security. GitOps enables faster recovery from failures
    through automated rollback capabilities, making it a more reliable and efficient
    method for managing modern software systems.
