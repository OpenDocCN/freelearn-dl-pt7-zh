			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Evolving Products into AI Products<a id="_idTextAnchor402"/></h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore the areas that benefit and negatively impact AI adoption in existing products. Every product will be different and every product owner will come to their own conclusions about what level of AI adoption to infuse into their product. For some products, something as simple as adding one AI feature is enough. For other products, a fundamental change to the underlying logic that powers your product might be required. The decisions of how to transform your product should, first and foremost, be determined by your product strategy and should serve your overarching company vision. These decisions should be collaborative and should come with a high level of <span class="No-Break">executive sponsorship.</span></p>
			<p>As the chapter continues, we will explore various areas of AI transformation, and they will serve as a step-by-step guide to building a product strategy that supports the evolution of your product. We will look at how to approach brainstorming about your AI options, which considerations will be most important as you brainstorm, how to evaluate your product’s performance within the competitive landscape, how to build a product strategy that sets you up for success, and ultimately which signposts and milestones will help you build confidence and which will indicate that you need to go back to the <span class="No-Break">drawing board.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you’re adding AI features or upgrading the existing logic of your product, having an established plan that supports your product strategy will be the best way to successfully update your product for commercial success with AI in a way that’s sustainable. Once you’ve achieved the successful transformation of your product into an AI product, feel free to refer to <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book where we go over the various aspects of building and maintaining an <span class="No-Break">AI-native product.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Venn diagram – what’s possible and <span class="No-Break">what’s probable</span></li>
				<li>Data is king – the bloodstream of <span class="No-Break">the company</span></li>
				<li>Competition – love <span class="No-Break">your enemies</span></li>
				<li>Product strategy – building a blueprint that works <span class="No-Break">for everyone</span></li>
				<li>Red flags and green flags – what to look and watch <span class="No-Break">out for</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Venn diagram – what’s possible and what’s probable</h1>
			<p>There are multiple ways in <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>which a product could stand to benefit from AI adoption, and understanding the Venn diagram of what’s probable and what’s possible is an important part of your AI product strategy journey. As you continue this exercise, you’ll go through a spectrum. You’ll start with a really open-ended, right-brain brainstorming session on the cerebral notion of value and how your product can deliver it to your customers, which will then be refined by a left-brain, analytical breakdown of the fruits of that brainstorming session. Both are important parts of the product management <span class="No-Break">creative process.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you look at your product from the perspective of the main problems your customers face, the <em class="italic">jobs to be done</em>, or feature parity, you’ll want to get a sense of which AI enhancements would be most high-value for your product, which would be the most low-cost, which have the best data readiness or availability, and which have the highest degree of executive or market sponsorship. Since this section is about how to evolve an existing product into an AI product, take your time with <span class="No-Break">this step.</span></p>
			<p>Feel free to refer to the <em class="italic">Additional resources</em> section at the end of this chapter for resources to help you and your organization learn<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> more about AI and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) in preparation for such a big step. Educating yourself, reading books and articles about how AI can bolster your product, and adopting a student mindset will be the most helpful thing you can do at the onset of this journey you’re taking – and it is a journey! Being mindful about taking your time to really familiarize yourself with the models, the benefits, and the options you have before you will <span class="No-Break">be important.</span></p>
			<p>Before we get into all that, a word of caution about adopting the term AI. We’ve discussed the notion of starting with your <em class="italic">why</em> when it comes to AI and how important it is. We’ve also discussed the notion of the marketing buzz that comes with AI and how attractive it is to investors and customers alike. In the current AI climate, there’s a lot of noise that’s generated when AI and ML enter the lexicon of your product’s communication efforts. You don’t want to fall victim to the trap of attracting a lot of attention without necessarily having the substance to support <span class="No-Break">that attention.</span></p>
			<p>The last thing we want is for product managers and technologists to go through the effort of investing in AI and push out vanity features that don’t actually make their products better only because they want to capitalize on the attention AI offers them. For that reason, we recommend grasping the real opportunities that AI and ML will afford your product and then creating a series of lists that will rank the order of these potential opportunities according to three key categories: value, scope, <span class="No-Break">and reach.</span></p>
			<p>The ultimate goal of brainstorming and creating these lists is to define a potential path to AI maturity within your product. Understanding which areas you want to start with and which areas you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> transform as part of your overall product strategy and roadmap over time will be an important part of the process. AI transformation won’t happen overnight. You will have to start somewhere and, given the cost of investing in AI, being strategic and intentional about where you want to start will make all the difference in the <span class="No-Break">long run.</span></p>
			<p>In the following sections, we will be applying various lenses to ideations when it comes to AI adoption. Those lenses will relate to how AI adoption will impact your product based on perceived value for your customers, how AI adoption will impact the scope of your product, and, finally, how AI adoption will spread to your <span class="No-Break">end users<a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>List 1 – value</h2>
			<p>The work of product management often requires a high level of trade-off. You’re always judging the amount of effort <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>and skill required to bring a feature to light and comparing that with the proposed upside for making that building investment. If you do, however, start with the highest-value AI enhancements, you’ll be coming from an intuitive, customer-centric place. Understanding first and foremost what makes your product valuable to your customers and your market and then finding use cases of AI to expand on that value should be the first order <span class="No-Break">of business.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll need a source of truth list like this later on when decisions become more difficult and – should they inevitably come up – you maneuver political discussions with leadership and other key stakeholders at your company. The reason why your value list should be your primary source of truth is that every product fundamentally needs a value proposition: a statement about why your product brings value to its customers and users. The world has enough false advertisements, overcommitments, and exaggerations, particularly in tech. Based on a 2019 study on European companies claiming to have cutting-edge AI products, up to 40% of them were not substantially using AI. Build a solid list of true AI enhancements that will deliver real value to your customers. Build an AI product you can be proud of. Start with what <span class="No-Break">really matters.</span></p>
			<p>Treat this as an exercise in <em class="italic">divergent thinking</em>. We spent <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>a considerable amount of this book going over the various use cases and models that can be employed in ML and deep learning. We’ve also looked at a number of verticals, industries, and high-level adoption trends. When you’re thinking about value and how to grow it in your product, use this list exercise as a way to get all the potential ideas out there no matter how outlandish or unrealistic. Keep in<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> mind the various strengths of AI: stacking, ranking, optimizing, predicting, grouping, comparing, automating, standardizing, and learning from ongoing trends <span class="No-Break">and analysis.</span></p>
			<p>How can you apply these strengths to your own product? Get creative and try not to stop logistical considerations from getting your ideas flowing. Anything that feels like it will be inherently valuable to even just a small subset of your customers can and should make this list. If it’s helpful, consider the various types of models we’ve covered in earlier chapters and what value they could bring to your product as it currently stands. Take stock of the benefits that various types of ML can potentially bring to your product and see where they might be able to improve on existing use cases that pertain to the product and <span class="No-Break">your customers.</span></p>
			<p>With due diligence, you should come out of this exercise feeling inspired about the potential directions your product can take based on its current value proposition. With some luck on top of that due diligence, you should also experience the new benefits AI can bring as well. There will be plenty of opportunities to whittle this list down and realistically refine <span class="No-Break">it later.</span></p>
			<p>For now, let the creativity flow and think about how you can build on the existing value your product offers its customers and users. You will be rewarded for being less discerning during this step because you never know which of the fringe ideas on this list might become valuable seeds for future features. Brainstorming about potential features and use cases is also some of the most fun a product manager can have – figure out a way to make this a standard part of your product strategy work and revisit this on a quarterly or <span class="No-Break">biannual ba<a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>sis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>List 2 – scope</h2>
			<p>Once you have a<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> list of the highest-value AI enhancements from the previous section, you can then start to prioritize them into a list of most to least scope. Scope includes not only the time and effort required to complete a body of work but also the cost and skill level required to do so. Given that we’re talking about AI products here, it may not be as straightforward to understand what will require the most effort, time, cost, and skill. Often, we don’t know this until we’re well on our way to building out these features, but do your best to create enough of a stacked order from most to least effort for <span class="No-Break">this list.</span></p>
			<p>This list won’t be an absolute source of truth, and it doesn’t have to be. It also doesn’t necessarily mean that the items that involve the least effort will get built first, but it’s important to establish which kinds of enhancements will require more of an investment from the company to complete. Understanding the variety in terms of effort is most important from a planning and resource management perspective. If certain features need to be built, and<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> they do require a lot of effort, time, or skill that you might not conveniently have, knowing this will help with forecasting and making the necessary plans in the future to <span class="No-Break">obtain it.</span></p>
			<p>It will also allow your leadership team the time and focus to really internalize what this investment in AI will actually require of them, and whether or not you currently have the skill sets and capabilities to even embark on this path. Taking the time to discuss the scope and get clear on the organization’s current level of ability is an essential part of this step. The act of acquiring the right tech resources to make the loftiest AI dreams a reality will likely be an arduous journey in and of itself. Your leadership team needs to be prepared <span class="No-Break">for that.</span></p>
			<p>This isn’t just the case with acquiring talent – it’s also the case with understanding what internal processes need to change as well. Often, when it comes to AI, managing expectations can be the most difficult part of making an AI transformation successful, so anything you can do early on to prime your leadership for the trials and tribulations that might impact you as you begin the process of leveraging AI will go a long way when hurdles inevitably <span class="No-Break">come up.</span></p>
			<p>As any product manager out there knows, the scope is an important factor in deciding what to build and when, and you’ll want to make sure you’re cementing yourself as the authority where leadership is concerned when it comes to the AI features you propose to add to your product. Even if you do have a mature team of data scientists and ML engineers around you who you can trust and who have a ton of experience and AI wisdom, as a product manager, you will still own the product and be responsible for the ultimate strategy related to your product. It’s important that you maintain this high level of oversight and command over your product’s key AI considerations and the major decisions impacting your product because you are the captain of that ship. Congratulations! It’s a gift and <span class="No-Break">a curse.</span></p>
			<p>If you can’t defend the decisions made in relation to your product, you’re not the authority, and this will only cause confusion and undermine your leadership later on. Remember that your technical team is there to support the product, offer sincere advice, and give their best estimates on the scope and on how to build the features that are decided on by the strategic arm of the organization. They are there to build and implement the decisions <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>that you make in collaboration with your leadership and stakeholder team. Having a clear definition of ownership and using your technical team to accurately reflect on the scope to the best of their ability is what this exercise is <span class="No-Break">al<a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>l about.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>List 3 – reach</h2>
			<p>By this point, you have two lenses through which to look at your proposed product AI embellishments – the lens of <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>ultimate value and the lens of scope: effort, time, skill level, and cost. As you may notice, with our second list, we’re moving from a divergent mindset and adding more analytical, convergent restraints. With this third list, you add another layer of conditions through the lens of how many of your existing customers it will impact – or <span class="No-Break">your reach.</span></p>
			<p>Being able to create this list will require you to have enough intimacy with your existing product as it currently stands, right down to the feature level. Understanding the baseline of how your subset of customers uses your product and which features have been most instrumental to them in their experience of your product will be necessary. You can’t accurately predict the reach of these proposed value items from your original list if you don’t already understand how your customers experience your product. You also won’t be able to articulate to your leadership team why certain AI embellishments will be valuable to your customers if you don’t already understand how they use <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>This seems like a really obvious statement but you’d be surprised how many product managers out there actually know very little about how their customers actually use their own products. Product managers can get caught in the trap of building their product team into a feature farm and few of them actually stop to make sure their product is being built holistically and sustainably, but maintaining intimacy with their customers and users is a big part of being a product manager. If you aren’t using product analytics or regularly checking in with your customers, either through direct customer interviews or through in-app/in-platform surveys, then you really don’t know how your customers experience <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>If you don’t have a strong grasp of how your customers use your product and what they find most valuable about it, then you’re building in the dark. If you’ve gotten to this part of the exercise and it’s just now dawning on you that you actually really don’t have this information, then you’ll want to start doing your homework and start this list creation exercise all over again. This once again ties back into the original value items we put on our first list. If you do find yourself in this situation, there’s no harm. Keep your original list. Get to know your customers and what they most love about your product and start the exercise over again. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>one of the beautiful things about product management. You can always find out more! There are deeper and deeper truths to uncover about your product the more you build and the more customers you take on. Never get discouraged. If there are unanswered questions, it’s only an opportunity <span class="No-Break">to learn.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have our priority list of potential sources of AI adoption based on value, scope, and reach, we can move on to the next big consideration for evolving a traditional software product into an AI product: data readiness. Making sure our data is in a digestible format to be able to handle the new AI capabilities is going to be the next big focus area for product managers looking to make the jum<a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>p <span class="No-Break">into AI.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Data is king – the bloodstream of the company</h1>
			<p>Before product managers can begin the work needed to start building and developing their product, getting it ready for testing, and releasing it to their customers, they need to get really clear on the strategy of how they will position their product. This is the thought process behind the Venn diagram exercise we saw in the previous section. Now that we’ve gone over the process of how product managers can approach potential AI embellishments, we can add one more layer of scrutiny to this list. This additional layer focuses on the data, which is what will<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> power every single item on these lists. Once product managers begin the work of understanding what they can do with the data sources they have and which data sources they’ll need to make the items on their list a reality, we’re getting close to actually having <span class="No-Break">a plan.</span></p>
			<p>In the following subsections, we will be addressing the key areas of data readiness. Preparing and researching the data you have available, assessing the quality of the data you have, using the data for benchmarking the current and future adoption of your product, partnering with your data team, and, ultimately, defining success through your data will all be necessary steps to ensuring you’ve covered your bases when it comes to data readiness and availabil<a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>ity <span class="No-Break">for AI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Preparation and research</h2>
			<p>Doing our due diligence with regard to research around our data sources and what insights they can deliver for us is part of the work we need to do to truly be ready to make decisions on AI integrations. Your <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>data readiness and availability will also have a huge impact on the executive and market sponsorship of your newly emerging AI product. You might also find yourself at the point where you’ve done these exercises only to realize that your data is not ready for the evolution of your product. Getting to that point might be an intermediary step to being able to launch AI version 2.0 of your product. Making sure you have flows of incoming data to support the features you want to go live with is the ultimate measure <span class="No-Break">of readiness.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, you haven’t created a product strategy for how you’re launching your newly minted AI product. We’re still in the early phases, so we want this phase of data discovery to come after the brainstorming exercise. The reason for this is that you can start to think about how to best gather, clean, and organize data in the ways your AI program will require of you as a foundational step that comes before building your product strategy. This is an important part of deciding on the core function and audience of your product or your product’s AI features. Taking stock of what data capability you currently have and how far you need to go to get to where you want to take your product is a step everyone faces when they’re scaling their existing product into an <span class="No-Break">AI product.</span></p>
			<p>Going through this process of brainstorming how your product can best leverage AI is ultimately an exercise of building out future use cases. Sure, your customers have come to know and understand your product as it currently stands, and there are some sets of established use cases already, but those use cases are likely to evolve with AI. Understanding what the current data pipelines that make your product function are and how those data pipelines need to change and mature to support your new ML pipeline is an integral part of the AI transformation process. You can’t avoid this step because if you do kick that can down the road and just let problems arise later on, you won’t get very far because all you’re going to get out of your models <a id="_idTextAnchor414"/><span class="No-Break">is nonsense.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Quality partnership</h2>
			<p>It’s become a cliche by now but within AI, data science, and ML circles, the age-old tagline is <em class="italic">garbage in, garbage out</em>. This is an <em class="italic">a priori</em> truth of AI. Your models won’t give you the insights and value you’re looking for if you don’t adequately prepare and clean your data. Should you find<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> yourself in this situation and ignore your AI/ML team’s recommendations, you’re going to be left defending an internal AI program that your leadership team will perceive to be a waste of time and money. And it will be a waste of time <span class="No-Break">and money!</span></p>
			<p>Rather than looking at your data pipeline strategy as the necessary input for your product, in an AI product life cycle, you’ll come to see it as the partner that co-creates your AI product alongside your models and developers. That might sound a bit dramatic, but your data pipeline is going to constitute a huge part of your AI/ML program. And you will need to think of it as a program. Orchestrating and coordinating your data sources and the quality of the data will be a huge part of your success with AI. Acknowledge that adopting AI is going to constitute a paradigm shift for your organization, and if you were able to skate by with incompatible silos of data wrought with duplicates and poisoned data wells in the past, this isn’t going to be the case when you <span class="No-Break">adopt AI.</span></p>
			<p>The biggest resistance that organizations face when it comes to data quality comes from inside: the internal resistance to keep processes as they’ve always been. Doing nothing is easy. Keeping things as they are will be the natural instinct for most people. Even if your organization is super passionate about maturing its data practice and you have champions across all major stakeholder teams within your organization, it still won’t be enough. You will need to evangelize the importance of shifting in mindset when it comes to data quality, as well as the cost and time associated with making this happen. It’s easy to make a verbal commitment to improving data quality and another to actually see that manifest tangibly in the behaviors <span class="No-Break">of teams.</span></p>
			<p>Expect internal resistance to this and do your best to communicate the risks of empty promises. Remember that when you’re changing workflows, processes, and departmental habits of a product that’s been around for a while, you have entire teams of people that have been used to doing things a certain way. Making those changes will be a collective effort. This isn’t just a product evolution that will happen because leadership said so. This is a product evolution that will require partnership from all employees that touch your existing product. Take time to manage your own expectations for this as well. There might be days when you’re frustrated and weeks where you’re not seeing changes and return to past bad habits. It’s a process and it will take time for this to be <span class="No-Break">fully <a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>internalized.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Benchmarking</h2>
			<p>Data is already the bloodstream of a company, empowering everything from internal decision-making to product performance. Your customer and product data will help you understand which parts of your<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> product are already valuable and will help you deduce which proposed features will have the most impact on your customers. Your historical internal data will help you understand which features have traditionally taken the longest to manifest in your product to predict <span class="No-Break">future scope.</span></p>
			<p>Your product analytics will help inform which UI/UX and design changes might have the most impact. Your training and performance data will help you understand which ML models work best for your customers. Your operational data will help you understand which deployments have been most successful and why. Data helps you manage your release schedule and product roadmap. Data helps you scale <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>Establishing an existing benchmark using data will be an important step in creating a narrative around your plans for adopting AI. This is because, in future quarters and years, you want to be able to demonstrate that AI has helped move the needle on some of your most compelling use cases both internally and externally. You won’t be able to know how far you’ve come later if you don’t have an established baseline from the <span class="No-Break">very beginning.</span></p>
			<p>As a product manager, you’ll want to speak from a position of strength when you demonstrate the milestones your product has been able to hit with AI. The business will evolve and metrics will come and go, but make the most of the data you already have before you embark on your AI adoption path so that you can truly reflect on your progress when t<a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>he <span class="No-Break">time comes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>The data team</h2>
			<p>The time you take on this step<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> will be up to you and your leadership team. You might want to use a data strategy consultant or have in-depth sessions with your technical stakeholders to really understand how to best organize your data pipelines in a way that will empower an AI adoption best. You may even want to establish a dedicated data team made up of cross-functional team members that will be responsible for the oversight of your data. Having dedicated folks to work out the details of centralizing the various silos of data you have and deciding on the best way to centralize<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> that data and send it to your models in dev and ultimately in production will be a great way to work through the various inconsistencies in your data that will inevitably <span class="No-Break">come up.</span></p>
			<p>Treat this as an investment in your R&amp;D and product design phase and give it the time it deserves because it’s a foundational part of your AI infrastructure. How you store your data, how often you’re calling it, how often you’ll need to train your models, and how you’ll be planning a release schedule to support this new AI infrastructure will all be a part of this discussion. At this stage, it’s just a discussion. No decisions are being made yet, but you will want to start this discussion as early as possible because, by the time you are ready to start considering models, training, and testing, you’re going to want to be sitting on clean, rich data to feed <span class="No-Break">those models.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding your data, exploring it, experimenting with it, wrangling it, preparing it for feature development (for ML models), using it in modeling, evaluating the performance of those models, and ultimately deploying it are all going to be regular discussion points. So, starting conversations about data strategy early on before any real decisions about how you’re going to leverage AI are finalized is a strategic move. It also allows for technical voices to become a part of this conversation sooner than they might have expected because adopting AI is a highly technical investment and those voices should be present <span class="No-Break">early on.</span></p>
			<p>As we’ve seen in prior chapters, feature engineering is a major part of making the models you choose to employ in your product successful. This further reinforces the idea that you need to make sure your technical teams weigh in on important decisions about what kinds of data are gathered and ultimately are used to tr<a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>ain <span class="No-Break">your models.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Defining success</h2>
			<p>You’ll also use your internal data to<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> set metrics, which we covered in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, in order to define what success looks like for your product. Defining success will be a collaborative act and it’s important for product managers of AI products to bring in all major stakeholders of the company to align on defining that success. If the product evolution into AI doesn’t include the voices of your go-to-market, sales, marketing, strategy, engineering, and leadership teams, it won’t have the appropriate level of sponsorship it will need to truly be effective, funded, and evangelized about internally <span class="No-Break">and externally.</span></p>
			<p>Perhaps most importantly, without the right level of sponsorship, the success of your product will also not be tied to your most important business objectives at the organizational level. Building the right level of data fluency with these teams and using data to support your claims about the direction your product is taking is non-negotiable. Be patient with yourself, your <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>organization, and your technical talent on data. Data is the whole thing. It’s what powers this entire endeavor we’re discussing. Don’t give in to the pressure to rush things. There are always business imperatives to get to market as quickly as possible. The instinct to just start and build as you go will always be something product managers and leaders alike will have to push against, but don’t <span class="No-Break">rush this.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve discussed the internal process of ideating potential areas of AI adoption within your product, as well as the stages of ensuring your data readiness to adopt AI, we can move on to your external environment. Your competitors will offer a landscape of possibilities when it comes to what AI adoption will look like for your product. We don’t advise mimicking your competitors’ AI strategy but, rather, taking what AI adoption looks like for your competition as input when you <a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>weigh <span class="No-Break">up options.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Competition – love your enemies</h1>
			<p>Using the data you already have will take you quite far, but there will always be a need to append this data with a feedback loop from the outside world. Understanding your competitors will help you inform your strategy. It will give you examples from your peers that have already made the jump that you’re looking to make. Some of the examples you see from your <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>competitors will be sources of inspiration and some examples will help you avoid certain mistakes. Doing your due diligence when researching your competitors, particularly those that have also embraced AI, will have some influence on what you choose to build and should be one of the factors that influences the lists we <span class="No-Break">established previously.</span></p>
			<p>Some will refute this point and say that you should build a product based on your own understanding of your market and your customers’ problems. The notion that you should focus on the problem you’re looking to solve without the sometimes eclipsing influence of the competitive landscape is well-meaning but <span class="No-Break">highly flawed.</span></p>
			<p>We don’t exist in a vacuum. Products are compared with others in their peer group and, in many cases, one product defines another. Whether you’re selling to consumers or other businesses, your product is going to be compared with similar products. Being aware of your competition doesn’t necessarily mean you will build like them but it does offer you a perspective that’s valuable and realistic. Ignoring the impact of your competitors’ influence on your<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> product would be like ignoring gravity. It’s going to impact you whether you think it will <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></p>
			<p>Another important point it would be remiss not to mention here is to recognize that a big part of your competition includes the past iterations of your own product. You’re competing with how you’ve done things. You’re competing with past versions of your product. Thinking critically about this past version, particularly the version that doesn’t leverage AI, is going to be a big part of your design process. Think about what the limitations are, and what opportunities, strengths, and challenges the old version of your product offered your customers. How can you capitalize on those opportunities, limitations, and challenges with this new version you’re building? Treat the old or current iteration of your product as its own threat to your <span class="No-Break">current product.</span></p>
			<p>As you think about your competitive landscape, you might be tempted to get down to the feature level and do a comparison matrix with your top competitors. This is often a worthwhile exercise, particularly for your sales, marketing, and engagement teams later down the line, but at this stage, it’s a bit too soon for that. Try to analyze your competition from the lens of the original value list we started out with. That value list shouldn’t just be a list of features you want to add to your product. It should be a summary of the types of value your product offers its users and customers. Features are descriptive and matter-of-fact. Values are closely tied <span class="No-Break">to worth.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re having trouble understanding the difference, start with the features themselves and then see whether you can go a step further with each feature and write down why that feature actually matters to your customer. If you can do this, then you’ll be able to do this exercise when evaluating the products that yours will be competing with. Try and get a sense of whether or not the products in your competitive landscape offer the same level of value to your market or not. Another way of looking at value, particularly with the competitors that have actually gone to market with their own AI features or upgrades, is to understand how those decisions might have impacted value perception in <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>Getting to know your competitors is a great way of not only understanding possible directions you can take with your own product but also getting a glimpse into where the industry that you work in is headed. Understanding the competitive landscape you’re playing in and how it’s changing can have a strong impact on your ability to see trends within your own industry and decide whether or not you want to be an active participant or an agent of change for those trends. Going to market is an entire specialization in and of itself and as a product manager, you’re wearing that hat to quite a large degree. The better <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>acquainted you can get with the market you’re serving and how that market is evolving with AI, the stronger position you’ll be in when it comes to making the call on how to leverage AI in your <span class="No-Break">own product.</span></p>
			<p>So far, we have brainstormed potential areas in which AI can be adopted in your existing product, grasped data readiness, and evaluated what AI adoption looks like in your competitive landscape. These are all valuable inputs you’re going to consider when it comes to crafting your product strategy now that it’s ready for its AI makeover. In the following section, we’ll cover how to build that new product strategy that aligns with all the<a id="_idTextAnchor424"/> ideating <span class="No-Break">we’ve done.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Product strategy – building a blueprint that works for everyone</h1>
			<p>By now, we’ve brainstormed potential ideas. We’ve taken an inventory of our data, as well as the insights that can come from our competition and greater market, and we’re finally able to come to the drawing board and build a product strategy that will reflect the next major era of our product. Going from a traditional software product to an AI product is no small feat and it should be treated as a massive overhaul of the product because so much of how we build, what we build, and how we store, collect, and use data will be <span class="No-Break">majorly renovated.</span></p>
			<p>Building a product strategy<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> will directly influence your product roadmap and this will help you realize which parts of your product will need to transform first to succeed in the actualization of your product’s AI transformation and commercial success. However, there’s a big difference between creating a product strategy that fits in with your product’s new value system and creating a product roadmap that reflects that strategy. The roadmap is a proposed timeline of major milestones and features that will be built in the year ahead. The roadmap should not come before your product strategy is agreed upon by your key stakeholders. The roadmap is derived from this strategy and not the other <span class="No-Break">way around.</span></p>
			<p>We don’t build what we can and hope for the best. We agree on what to build using the collective knowledge and wisdom we’ve gathered about our product and how to best go to market with AI capabilities. In the following subsections, we will cover the product strategy process and a proposed list of how to develop a product strategy that works for all your <span class="No-Break">major stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>In the section that follows, we <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>will cover how to best execute a product roadmap that supports the growth of AI features and capabilities. This isn’t necessarily a how-to because the order and the contributions you take in will depend on your specific product. Rather, this can be viewed as more of a checklist to ensure you’re headed in the <span class="No-Break">right direction:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Knowledge gathering</span></li>
				<li>A product vision that aligns with the <span class="No-Break">company vision</span></li>
				<li>The establishment of <span class="No-Break">product goals</span></li>
				<li>V1 of product roadmap agreed upon <a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>by all <span class="No-Break">key stakeholders</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>Product strategy</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Product management</strong> is a creative<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> job first and foremost and the most difficult part is knowing where to start. The beauty of starting with a product that already <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>exists is that you have a starting point. Once you’re able to get started with some of the lists and exercises we’ve already gone over in this chapter, you’re ready to start building your product strategy. This will serve as a high-level plan for how your product will be built over time and incorporates the many facets of expressing a product: the marketing, the distribution channels, and how it will be communicated to your customers. Whether your product is an AI product or not, you shouldn’t create your product strategy internally without giving a voice to the folks tha<a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>t will use <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<h3>Knowledge gathering</h3>
			<p>Having a catalog of feedback from <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>your customers and prospects is a great way to make sure you have a feedback loop with the customers and users who will ultimately be deriving value from your product. Hopefully, you already have a culture of this at your company. It’s shocking how undisciplined companies can be about making sure to have regular feedback, whether through product interviews one on one or in-app surveys that capture your customers’ sentiments. Brainstorm which method is best for your product and market and regularly get feedback from your potential and <span class="No-Break">current customers.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, you already have a strong foundation to build on. You have the results of your lists, you have a <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>good sense of your data requirements, and you have your competitive analysis insights, along with some of the top recommendations from your key stakeholders that you’ve collected through various meetings and brainstorming sessions. You’re able to organize all of that and get some idea of where you can best leverage AI to bring your product to the next level. One key piece missing from that is your customer feedback. Reconciling all of this will be an act of putting all these pieces together in a rough draft, which will allow you to get to the heart of what building a product strategy is all about: deciding what your organization wants to achieve with your product and creating a product strategy that aligns with yo<a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>ur overall <span class="No-Break">company vision.</span></p>
			<h3>Establishing the vision and goals</h3>
			<p>We won’t go into the specifics of <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>what having a company mission statement or vision is about, but suffice it to say that there will be one. If it doesn’t exist, this is a great moment to generate a simple statement that encapsulates why your organization exists in the first place. What is it trying to achieve and what is the vision? From this point, your product vision is about aligning with your organization’s higher-level goals for the market it’s serving. In your product vision, you’re looking to simply explain how you see your product serving its target market. What are the needs and problems your customers and market face and how does your product meet those needs? Try to nail this down before you think about how AI shapes that vision, and then take a moment to reflect on what changes when you bring in AI. Try to whittle this down to one sentence if you can – two if you absolutely <span class="No-Break">need to.</span></p>
			<p>Gathering feedback and crafting a product vision are all collaborative efforts that are not done exclusively by the product manager. Rather, the product manager brings the right voices together to make sure a collective sentiment is agreed upon by the stakeholder team. You should be the person that organizes the meetings in which these things are decided and it’s your job to make sure you leave those meetings with something everyone present can live with. You’ll meet with your stakeholders regularly in those product strategy meetings we already discussed and you’ll have many opportunities to reevaluate how this <span class="No-Break">vision evolves.</span></p>
			<p>Next up, you establish goals for your product – you can’t really have a strategy without establishing high-level goals. These goals will be a critical thinking task that will spring from your product vision, particularly now that this vision encapsulates the adoption of AI in whatever form makes <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>sense for <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>What are you actually trying to achieve with <span class="No-Break">your product?</span></p>
			<p>Are there certain major milestones or benchmarks that you’re hoping to achieve <span class="No-Break">with AI?</span></p>
			<p>Goals exist to help you measure and prepare for important objectives that you want to reach with your product, for your customers, users, market, developers, and the rest of the employees in your organization. Consider these your strategic OKRs for <span class="No-Break">your product.</span></p>
			<p>Without putting these big boulders in and building your product vision and goals from the place of what’s most important, you’ll drown in the weeds and you won’t build strategically. You’ll be left chasing opportunities unintentionally and it may tempt you to just follow what your competitors are doing or what your customers are asking for. Given the importance of the move to AI, take the time here to begin from a place of strength. If you find yourself weighing feedback from your competitive analysis, your customers, or your internal teams disproportionately when finding this vision and establishing your product goals, think critically about whether that’s <span class="No-Break">actually appropriate.</span></p>
			<p>Feel free to also make this process collaborative and jot down all the goals that occur to all your various stakeholders so that you can prioritize them together. Again, you can always revisit these goals and scrutinize them later, but try and see what you can come up with together, refine that list, and try to stick to three to four higher-level product goals here so that you can begin to approach your product roadmap with confidence. All these goals will manifest in being broken down into smaller bits and those bits may take weeks, months, or even years to fully realize. That’s OK. Your product goals shouldn’t be something that can happen in days and weeks. They should be encompassing and strategic enough that they are long-lasting because they’re there to inform your overall product roadmap and to ensure everyone is working i<a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>n service to a <span class="No-Break">unifying goal.</span></p>
			<p>The <span class="No-Break">product roadmap</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we’ve made it to the <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>product roadmap. This is the last step toward establishing our product strategy and it’s the most detailed part because it’s meant to capture initiatives that have come from all of the strategic goal-setting and vision exercises. This is where the magic of building and shipping products is. Taking strategic nebulous goals and turning them into a tangible reality, the roadmap is where we apply the conditions, limitations, and dependencies that we haven’t yet bothered with. Roadmaps will change and they’re not meant to be crystal balls, rendering your fate non-negotiable. They are meant to serve as guides for a product team’s strategic directives. They are meant to be a bird’s-eye, calendar view translation of your product vision <span class="No-Break">and goals.</span></p>
			<p>Virtually everyone in your organization is going to see your product roadmap and it will serve as a blueprint for all teams to use to align when it comes to their own goals and planning sessions. It’s also a way to communicate the results of all your strategy sessions. It’s also meant to serve as a guardrail for all kinds of projects, initiatives, and <span class="No-Break">implementation issues.</span></p>
			<p>If deadlines, issues, or bottlenecks arise, as they inevitably will, your internal teams have an internal source of truth to give them guidance on how much leeway they have, and it also gives them structure around when to escalate things because a roadmap is marked by months and quarters. This is an especially important note with AI products because as you build, you will start to see certain experiments or projects taking longer than expected. Your regular product strategy sessions will make sure to absorb the shock of any major changes to deadlines or <span class="No-Break">the scope.</span></p>
			<p>Establishing a product roadmap will also ensure you’re aligning the efforts of your product design, development, UX, success, marketing, and sales with your strategic goals. Each major initiative you include in your roadmap will have its own documentation that comes with it in the form of user stories or product requirement docs, and all major initiatives will come with some kind of acceptance criteria. This makes it so that your roadmap is tied to the manifestation of specific outcomes. The roadmap isn’t just a collection of features you plan to deliver by a certain date. It’s a representation of the outcomes you expect to see from your development efforts. Multiple features may be in service to <span class="No-Break">these outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>As you start to establish a backlog of epics and tasks, you’ll start to align them with the themes present in your product goals and initiatives as they get further grouped into sprints and releases. The product team, along with the AI product manager, will own the product roadmap creation and maintenance and will continuously break down elements of the roadmap into individual tasks with their own acceptance criteria. Themes will start to emerge as you go. The roadmap will be a reflection of the initiatives and outcomes that are most compelling, whether it’s because they have the biggest impact on customers or whether they offer the greatest ROI to <span class="No-Break">the business.</span></p>
			<p>The last thing to keep in mind about establishing the roadmap is that, as an AI product manager, you’ll take whatever<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> version of your product roadmap is final enough and you’ll begin the work of evangelizing about that roadmap to your greater organization. Up until now, all of this has been a collaborative effort, but you can’t get very far if your group of collaborators is too wide. Establishing a stakeholder team to work with that’s representative enough of leadership, development, product, and go-to-market teams is a strategic task in and of itself. They will help you get to this point in the process. Now that you’ve gotten to this point, you’re going to spread the word and get feedback from the rest of the organization because everyone will use it as a guideline. This offers you another level of scrutiny and allows for additional voices to raise concerns that might not have come up with the core <span class="No-Break">stakeholder team.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you have a product strategy and roadmap you can be proud of (yes, this is the intended final state), we have great news for you: it’s never going to be finished! This is just the first iteration of the current state of affairs. The goal here isn’t to finish anything, it’s to agree on the starting point. Over time, your strategy and roadmap will both evolve and you will revisit them regularly. We recommend making this a biweekly or monthly process if you’re in a relatively new organization and making it monthly or quarterly if you’re at a more mature organization where things move more slowly. Make sure you’re crafting your roadmap in a way where you’re planning at least two quarters out so that you’re strategic with your resources <span class="No-Break">and time.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll be the keeper of this meeting as the AI product manager and it will be your responsibility to make sure your core group of key stakeholders is regularly included in this strategic meeting. Keeping lines of communication open and allowing space for new ideas and alterations to make their way into your product strategy and roadmap is a responsible way of not just capturing all the new energy that will come from building through your plans as they stand but is also a way to regularly welcome new perspectives. It’s easy to get really great ideas when you’re always brainstorming. When you’re in the practice of just executing, brainstorming becomes a luxury that your time rarely affords, and things become <span class="No-Break">get stale.</span></p>
			<p>Resist the temptation to make these meetings ad hoc and only bring the party together when ideas start to stagnate. That’s not a good practice because it puts a lot of pressure on your stakeholders to perform when the well has already run dry. Keeping this meeting scheduled regularly <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>will make sure that your stakeholders expect it and get used to coming to it with their own ideas. Keep the meetings up and even if you do run out of ideas or motivation, you can always shorten them when they do arise and give yourself more <span class="No-Break">time back.</span></p>
			<p>Remaining committed to keeping a standing meeting means that your stakeholders can take it upon themselves to keep a running list of topics and considerations to bring up in these meetings. It also keeps you honest by keeping you out of the very understandable and common pattern of staying in execution mode. When we’re there for too long, our vision can get blurred by the inertia of building products. Maintaining the product strategy is your ultimate responsibility and it consists primarily of the strategic elements that happen when building your product vision, goals, and roadmap. Having regular product strategy meetings makes you a<a id="_idTextAnchor431"/> good steward of <span class="No-Break">your strategy.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Red flags and green flags – what to look for and watch out for</h1>
			<p>Moving forward into the wide frontier of AI products includes some common pitfalls in AI transformation, as well as markers for success. We will call them red flags and green flags and they’re signals you can pick up on as you go through this process of getting your product ready for AI adoption. Some of these will be concrete actions or results and some will be more emotional, but either way, you can use them as markers to know whether you’re on the right path or whether you’re hitting potential rough patches. In the following subsections, we’ll address a few red and green flags<a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>. Let’s <span class="No-Break">get started.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Red flags</h2>
			<p>Red flags are behavioral patterns we<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> can try and look out for that indicate there is an issue with a process we’re setting forth. Because AI adoption is such a revolutionary undertaking for any company to take on, it’s best to look out for some of these habitual patterns early so that you’re starting on the <span class="No-Break">right foot:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">I don’t know</strong>: If you’re regularly engaging with various teammates or employees on different teams at your company and they seem confused about why the company is adopting AI, what the value will be for their customers or readers, and what the product’s high-level goals are, that’s a red flag. The point of crafting a product strategy <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>that aligns with the move to embrace AI is to make sure no one in your organization is confused about why this is happening. Make sure the entire company knows why you’re adopting AI and which use cases you’re trying to solve <span class="No-Break">with it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication stalls</strong>: If you’re not meeting regularly or there’s a lack of engagement in your recurring product meetings, there’s likely some internal resistance you have to deal with. Do your best to communicate the exciting opportunity that embracing AI is, not just in terms of your product but the market as a whole. Rather than seeing AI transformation as a burden that’s going to be a lot of work, you’ll know you’re on the right path when you can sense curiosity and openness from the stakeholders that hold leadership positions at the organization they serve. A lack of executive engagement is a critical red flag. AI isn’t something leadership can outsource. They need to be involved and engaged at every stage of your AI <span class="No-Break">adoption journey.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">You’re not seeing progress</strong>: If you’ve started the process of working on creating your AI/ML pipeline and you don’t see progress or at least some early positive signals from the model training you’re starting, you might not have the right skill level to truly tackle the undertaking that is AI transformation. Making sure you have the right talent team, tech stack, and know-how is hard to do at the onset, and many companies struggle with establishing the right combination of factors as they get started with this. If you are struggling for talent, consider working with AI consultancies that can help you leverage from a diverse talent pool that’s had exposu<a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>re to use cases similar <span class="No-Break">to yours.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Green flags</h2>
			<p>In this section, we wanted to include a few green flags that might appear as red flags at first glance. In part, we want to prepare you for some of the hurdles you’ll encounter on your journey to help manage your own expectations, but we also want to convey that the following behavioral patterns are often a sign of things going right even if you might not experience them <span class="No-Break">that way:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Your pilot project fails</strong>: It was probably going to anyway. We’ve talked so much about managing <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>expectations and this is really what it’s all about. Whether you’re balancing your own reaction or the reactions of others in the face of lackluster performance or no performance at all, you’re going to have to act as a source of faith for yourself and others. ML works and companies all over the world use it constructively and productively every day. Those with the patience and determination to see it through will be rewarded, but it can be hard to see progress, particularly at the beginning and when you’re starting from the perspective of a traditional software product. Give it time and don’t <span class="No-Break">give up.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Too much feedback</strong>: Whether from your customers, prospects, users, or internal teams, if you find yourself inundated with feedback about what should make it to the roadmap and what shouldn’t, take it as a sign that you’ve succeeded in properly evangelizing your product vision, goals, and roadmap. When it comes to AI transformation, having more voices involved early on can be exhausting, but it’s also an amazing indication that people are engaged. It’s a good problem to have. Being the referee is easier than being the cheerleader that’s trying to muster up excitement where there <span class="No-Break">is none.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reimagining data consumption</strong>: If your internal teams are changing how they use and ingest data, that means the culture is changing toward becoming more data-driven, which will further support the success of your AI platform. If your organization realizes they have to massively overhaul how they annotate, store, collect, and use data, that means the AI transformation has gotten to a phase where it’s affecting internal teams and the <span class="No-Break">predominant climate.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As the AI product manager, you’ll want to be aware of the potential hurdles to look out for, as well as the indicators that your AI adoption is going well. Your organization will be looking to your leadership as this journey unfolds. Your credibility in this area will be cemented if you can be a safe <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>haven for your colleagues when things go wrong and a source of encouragement when thing<a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>s seem to be going wrong <span class="No-Break">but aren’t.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We’ve now come to the last chapter of the last section of our book: evolving an existing product into an AI product. So much of this chapter has been about how to anticipate and prepare for the jump to AI/ML. In the second section of the book, we heavily discussed concepts related to the AI-native product: a product that’s created with AI initially. Once you do make the jump to fully embracing AI in your own product, you can refer to <em class="italic">Part 2 </em>of this book, which is more focused on the aspects that come up when you’re in the flow of building AI. In this section, we wanted to focus on the preparation stages for embracing AI/ML because of the gravity that comes with <span class="No-Break">AI transformation.</span></p>
			<p>Brainstorming ideas, vetting those ideas with practical considerations, getting your data right, evaluating the competitive landscape you’ll be playing in, and bringing in your stakeholders to make a plan for how to build the transition are all part of AI readiness. All of the ideas expressed in this chapter are also easier said than done and each section of this chapter will be a process in and of itself, but once you are able to get to the point where you’ve decided on a product strategy and you’re executing that strategy with a product roadmap that your entire organization can get behind, you’re on your way to building <span class="No-Break">with AI.</span></p>
			<p>It’s a privilege and a massive responsibility to be a product manager, particularly one that oversees the AI transformation of their product. It’s an exciting time in your product management career and one that you’ll likely look back on fondly. We’re at a unique precipice in history and not many product managers can say they were able to be of service in such a big step for their organizations and their respective products. As you hit difficult moments along this journey, remind yourself that this is a difficult transformation to manage and evangelize for others in your <span class="No-Break">organization too.</span></p>
			<p>Embracing AI and all the challenges that come with it isn’t for the faint of heart and if you find yourself getting frustrated, it’s actually a great sign. It means you care enough about your product and your organization’s success with AI to elicit an emotional reaction. Give yourself and your co-creators grace and be proud of the work you’re all doing co<a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>l<a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>lectively to embrace the wave <span class="No-Break">of AI.</span></p>
