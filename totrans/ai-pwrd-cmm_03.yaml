    which allows machines to interpret human text and reasoning, and then return a
    response that the user can understand. The ability to do this is often referred

    patterns in data using neural networks. This approach makes use of large amounts

    user reviews for specific features that users want to be added to their products.
    For example, if you go to Amazon right now and look at the reviews section for
    any popular product, you will see dozens of customer comments asking about the
    product features, either explicitly or implicitly. A popular snack includes comments
    such as *flavor is mediocre* and *the snacks are clumped together*.

    architecture**, or **Seq2Seq**. As the name suggests, Seq2Seq is a neural network
    that transforms a sequence     of elements, such as a string of text, into another sequence.'

    over the lazy dog`, the model might like to know what animal a `dog` is referring
    to. This task involves encoding the word `dog` into a numerical token that can
    be calculated regarding other tokens.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for the words `wolf` and `pet`. Of course, this is hugely simplifying the matter,
    as every character and every word gets a token, creating a huge network that computers
    can use to understand language.

    had previously been thought impossible. As we mentioned previously, this model
    uses sentence structure as an input feature – or you could call it an *input vector*
    – so we can see how this works at a conceptual level here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sentences are parameters in supervised sequence models such as Seq2Seq; they
    are fed through an encoder, which turns them into vectors (latent variables).
    These are then passed through one or more networks before being turned back into
    sequences for output processing (decoding).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These models aren't just called transformers because they transform sentences;
    they also transform characters into characters (or words). A character transformer
    doesn't just process words but also letters. It processes each character individually
    instead of taking groups of characters at once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are differences between character transformer models and word processors
    such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages. However, they all do something similar
    under the hood: they process raw data with a computer algorithm until a result
    pops up on the screen that we humans can read easily.'

    need excellent reading and writing skills before becoming truly useful. Whether
    we want robots to vacuum our floors or serve us dinner depends on how good their
    language comprehension capabilities are. We need robots who can understand natural
    language sentences in context before we teach them specific tasks.

    to make images in much the same way that they can write text, as seen in this
    example of a chair, which has been designed with the help of AI image generation:'

    as an extended process. They think that once they have a good idea, they can immediately
    build it and get it to market. But this line of thinking is fundamentally flawed.
    The most successful products in history were not developed overnight but rather
    evolved through systematic planning and execution processes. This basic path is

    For example, if your company is far along with its current product and it's not
    suffering from any major competitive threats, then perhaps it can afford to take
    some time off to work on something completely different. However, if you're still
    working on development and planning for a new release of your current product,
    then pivoting into something new may make less sense.

    yours, they may be able to start building right away without much need for training
    or retraining. Alternatively, if it takes many people with complementary skill
    sets to build products successfully (as it does at companies such as Facebook),
    then you may want to expand your team first before starting a project that requires
    more than one person (such as hiring designers and writers). You might also consider
    partnering with other organizations that have relevant skills (for example, Twitter
    has relied on outside contractors as part of its engineering teams).

    of fundraising activity and cash reserves. If you're raising money or looking
    for investors now but don't have significant revenue streams generating profits,
    then spending money on risky projects that aren't likely to be profitable immediately
    isn't so crucial at first. However, once things get going again (and assuming
    investors continue believing in your business model), launching products quickly
    will allow them to generate revenue faster.

    is not changed, teams add new features, new capabilities, and new functionality
    in response to what users want. An example is Yahoo's acquisition of Flickr in
    2005\. At the time, Flickr was already a popular destination for people looking
    to share photos and videos with other users online. But by buying Flickr, the
    Yahoo team could create an even more compelling user experience by providing photo
    sharing.

    to a global communications and media platform. Facebook started in college dorm
    rooms, and many early users wanted a casual way to stay in touch with their friends.
    But as Facebook became more popular, it attracted more professional users who
    wanted greater benefits from the site. In response, the team created new features
    such as Events and Groups that helped people find groups of friends they didn't
    know well but could use as sounding boards for career advice or to help them organize
    their workday.

    your organization is going through an innovation process similar to this one,
    you'll want to make sure you have a strategy for iteration at each step of the
    way. The lesson here is that an innovation process should be guided by user wants
