    which allows machines to interpret human text and reasoning, and then return a
    response that the user can understand. The ability to do this is often referred

    For example, if you go to Amazon right now and look at the reviews section for
    any popular product, you will see dozens of customer comments asking about the
    product features, either explicitly or implicitly. A popular snack includes comments
    such as *flavor is mediocre* and *the snacks are clumped together*.

    techniques, which are used by designers, architects, and engineers who are stuck

    in ideation processes, via surveys or focus groups, where they share their opinions
    about what they want. While this approach can be better for incorporating customer
    feedback, it's also costly and time-consuming. Domain experts have to manually
    take notes, collate and analyze feedback, and merge this with external data to
    move forward. They then need to find a way to collaborate with the actual product
    development teams to ensure that feedback is understood and used.

    video reviews, voice surveys, and more. AI is also much faster than humans, which
    means this data can be extracted, organized, and analyzed in real time, providing
    insights directly to product teams. This organized data acts as the fuel for creative

    sets to build products successfully (as it does at companies such as Facebook),
