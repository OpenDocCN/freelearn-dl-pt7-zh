    likely to succeed is a valuable asset for product managers, but it can be difficult
    for teams to manage on their own. This is where artificial intelligence can help.
    AI can provide a comprehensive understanding of the market by analyzing numerous
    data sources in real time, including social media posts and online conversations,

    state of the market situation – all things that a proactive product manager would
    find useful when trying to develop an innovative product within a competitive

    changes coming at them from all angles. Using AI in this way can help companies

    For example, a market might be defined by the attributes of its participants –
    such as how many users it has or their experience level – or the attributes of
    what they buy and sell, such as in a subscription model.'

    features it should have. In particular, market DNA includes key product features.
    For example, if you're in the smartwatch market, a key feature is battery life.
    So, you may want a smartwatch with long battery life to capture the attention
    of consumers.

    product's purpose and building features that meet those needs. But it's rare for
    product teams to have data on how customers use their products – especially in
    early-stage companies where feature sets are still being defined. This is where
    Commerce.AI can help.

    can help product teams fine-tune their feature set and product strategy. For example,
    if a large percentage of users are using your product for one-off use but not
    regular use, this is a red flag that you might want to rethink the purpose of
    your product or its target user. Let's dive into these ideas more deeply by understanding
    market attributes, user wants and needs, finding new use contexts, and more.

    everything for every possible user. This approach can quickly lead to feature
    creep and delays in shipping features as you need to add support for more use
    cases.

    suggests that people generally prefer long-term products over short-term ones;
