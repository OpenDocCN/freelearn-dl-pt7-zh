    in keeping yourself updated with the recent advancements in technology. This book
    deals with the three big trends in the current business scenario, **Internet of
    Things** (**IoT**), big data, and **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**). The exponential
    growth of the number of devices connected to the internet, and the exponential
    volume of data created by them, necessitate the use of the analytical and predictive
    techniques of AI and **deep learning** (**DL**). This book specifically targets
    the third component, the various analytical and predictive methods or models available
    in the field of AI for the big data generated by IoT.

    on how they're interdependent. The data generated by IoT devices is uploaded to
    the cloud, hence you'll also be introduced to the various IoT cloud platforms
    and the data services they offer.

    data fed to computers was generated by humans; he proposed that the best way would
    be for computers to take data directly, without any intervention from humans.
    And so he proposed things such as RFID and sensors, which gather data, should
    be connected to the network, and feed directly to the computer.

    device (or even mobile phone), an RFID-tagged animal, or even our day-to-day devices
    such as a refrigerator, washing machine, or even a coffee machine. These things
    can be physical things—that is, things that exist in the physical world and can
    be sensed, actuated, and connected—or of the information world (a virtual thing)—that
    is, things that aren''t tangibly present but exist as information (data) and can
    be stored, processed, and accessed. These things necessarily have the ability
    to communicate directly with the internet; optionally, they might have the potentiality

    to generate power, the gas turbine and the steam turbine. There''re three main
    components of the CCPP plant: gas turbine, heat recovery system, and steam turbine.
    The dataset, available at UCI ML ([http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant)),
    was collected by Pinar Tufekci from Namik Kemal University and Heysem Kaya from
    Bogazici University. The data consists of four features determining the average
    ambient variables. The averages are taken from various sensors located around
    the plant that record ambient variables per second. The aim is to predict the
    net hourly electrical energy output. The data is available in both `xls` and `ods`
    formats.'

    10 micrometers (PM10) and PM25 (2.5 micrometers or less), and temperature. The
