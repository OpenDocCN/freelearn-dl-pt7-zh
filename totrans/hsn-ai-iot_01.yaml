- en: Congratulations on purchasing this book; it suggests that you're keenly interested
    in keeping yourself updated with the recent advancements in technology. This book
    deals with the three big trends in the current business scenario, **Internet of
    Things** (**IoT**), big data, and **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**). The exponential
    growth of the number of devices connected to the internet, and the exponential
    volume of data created by them, necessitate the use of the analytical and predictive
    techniques of AI and **deep learning** (**DL**). This book specifically targets
    the third component, the various analytical and predictive methods or models available
    in the field of AI for the big data generated by IoT.

  zh: 恭喜你购买了本书；这表明你对跟进最新的科技进展充满兴趣。本书讨论的是当前商业环境中的三大趋势——**物联网**（**IoT**）、大数据和**人工智能**（**AI**）。随着连接互联网的设备数量呈指数级增长，并且这些设备生成的数据量也在指数级增加，使用人工智能和**深度学习**（**DL**）的分析与预测技术变得至关重要。本书专门针对第三个组件——物联网生成的大数据所需的各种分析和预测方法或模型，进行深入讲解。
- en: This chapter will briefly introduce you to these three trends and will expand
    on how they're interdependent. The data generated by IoT devices is uploaded to
    the cloud, hence you'll also be introduced to the various IoT cloud platforms
    and the data services they offer.

- en: The term IoT was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999\. At that time, most of the
    data fed to computers was generated by humans; he proposed that the best way would
    be for computers to take data directly, without any intervention from humans.
    And so he proposed things such as RFID and sensors, which gather data, should
    be connected to the network, and feed directly to the computer.

  zh: “物联网”（IoT）这个术语是由凯文·阿什顿（Kevin Ashton）于1999年提出的。那时，大多数输入到计算机的数据都是由人类生成的；他提出，最好的方法是让计算机直接获取数据，而不需要任何人为干预。因此，他提出像RFID和传感器这样的设备，应该连接到网络，直接向计算机提供数据。

    network) refers to a wide range of things such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones
    connected to the internet. These things can be anything: a person with a wearable
    device (or even mobile phone), an RFID-tagged animal, or even our day-to-day devices
    such as a refrigerator, washing machine, or even a coffee machine. These things
    can be physical things—that is, things that exist in the physical world and can
    be sensed, actuated, and connected—or of the information world (a virtual thing)—that
    is, things that aren''t tangibly present but exist as information (data) and can
    be stored, processed, and accessed. These things necessarily have the ability
    to communicate directly with the internet; optionally, they might have the potentiality
    of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage, and data processing.'

    plants. Your boss asks you to go for a week-long trip, and you're worried your
    plants won't survive for a week without water. The IoT solution is to add soil
    moisture sensors to your plants, connect them to the internet, and add actuators
    to remotely switch on or off the water supply and artificial sunlight. Now, you
    can be anywhere in the world, but your plants won't die, and you can check the
    individual plant's soil moisture condition and water it as needed.

    Many companies today provide IoT platform services, where they help not only with
    data but also enable seamless integration with different hardware. Since they
    function as a mediator between the hardware and application layer, IoT platforms
    are also referred to as IoT middleware and are part of the service layer in the
    IoT reference stack. IoT platforms provide the ability to connect and communicate
    with things from anywhere in the world. In this book, we'll briefly cover some

    team; it has functions and APIs for implementing deep neural networks. It works
    with Python, C++, Java, R, and Go. It can be used to work on multiple platforms,
    CPU, GPU, mobile, and even distributed. TensorFlow allows for model deployment
    and ease of use in production. The optimizer in TensorFlow makes the task of training
    deep neural networks easier by automatically calculating gradients and applying
    them to update weights and biases.
