    the speaker’s identity, is a powerful feature in multispeaker speech processing.
    It addresses the question of *who spoke when?* In a given audio clip, it is crucial
    to enhance the functionality and usability of ASR systems. The origins of speaker
    diarization can be traced back to the 1990s when the foundational work for clustering-based
    diarization paradigms was laid down. These early studies focused on radio broadcast
    news and communications applications, primarily aiming to improve ASR performance.

    the use of **Gaussian mixture models** (**GMMs**) and **hidden Markov models**

    timestamps and speaker diarization, a feature not natively supported by Whisper.
    WhisperX builds upon the foundational strengths of Whisper by addressing some
    of its limitations, particularly in timestamp accuracy and speaker diarization.
    While Whisper provides utterance-level timestamps, WhisperX advances this by offering
    word-level timestamps, crucial for applications requiring precise synchronization
    between text and audio, such as subtitling and detailed audio analysis. This is
    achieved through combining techniques, including VAD, pre-segmentation of audio
    into manageable chunks, and forced alignment with an external phoneme model to
    provide accurate word-level timestamps.

    by Whisper, with alignment currently available for English audio. It has been
    upgraded to incorporate the latest Whisper models and diarization technologies
    powered by Pyannote to enhance its performance further. At the time of writing,
    WhisperX incorporates `whisper-large-v3` along with diarization upgrades to speaker-diarization-3.1
    and segmentation-3.0, powered by Pyannote. WhisperX demonstrates significant improvements
    over Whisper in word segmentation precision and recall, as well as reductions
    in WER and increases in transcription speed, especially when employing batched
    transcription with VAD preprocessing.

    other speakers. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the transcription
    may not indicate speaker changes, such as when a speaker’s utterance is interrupted
