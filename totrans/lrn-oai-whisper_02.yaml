    speech recognition devices aimed at deciphering digits spoken over the telephone.
    They used analog circuits to match acoustic patterns to individual numbers, enabling
    the routing of calls based on verbally provided account or contact numbers. While
    limited in scope, these specialized machines represented some of the first attempts
    at ASR through template matching. Audrey marked an early milestone, though substantial
    innovation was still needed for more flexible systems that could handle continuous
    speech.

    extensive expert feature engineering, which was challenging to scale across languages.

    error rate** (**WER**) of 5.9 percent, equal to that of people who were asked

    **long short-term memory** (**LSTM**) acoustic models combined with a novel spatial
    smoothing method and **lattice-free maximum mutual information** (**LF-MMI**)
    acoustic training. They also employed multiple RNN language models and large amounts

    architecture is implemented as an encoder-decoder transformer, where input audio
    is processed in a two-step process. First, it generates a mathematical representation
    of the audio and then decodes this representation into a sequence of text tokens.
    This process is characteristic of an end-to-end approach, where the entire task
    – from raw audio input to text output – is handled by a single, integrated model.

    extraction from the input voice communication. This is followed by acoustic modeling,
    which maps the acoustic features to phonetic units. The next step is pronunciation
    modeling, which maps the phonetic units to words. Finally, language modeling is
    used to predict the probability of a sequence of words, producing the final transcript.

    audio (weakly supervised pre-training) and 4 million hours of pseudo-labeled audio

    **parseable language constructs** into the model. These constructs are essentially
    patterns and structures in the language that the model learns to recognize and

    language constructs transfer to the new tasks. This means the model can apply
    the patterns and structures discovered during pre-training to recognize and transcribe
    speech in the downstream tasks. In essence, the weakly supervised pre-training

    word candidates matching learned vocabulary patterns. This linguistic familiarity
