    that redefine the way businesses operate and innovate. Among these, **generative
    artificial intelligence** (**GenAI**) stands out as a groundbreaking advancement,
    capable of reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace. The excitement surrounding
    GenAI is palpable, with organizations across the globe racing to understand its
    potential and implement it effectively. Yet, for many, the journey from curiosity
    to implementation is fraught with complexity and uncertainty.
