    European bank’s approach to call center optimization and customer-credit decisions.
    According to the report *Confronting the risks of artificial intelligence* ([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/confronting-the-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/confronting-the-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/))
    by McKinsey & Company, the bank applied advanced analytics and AI capabilities
    while adhering to rigorous risk management principles. The bank implemented a
    robust set of business principles detailing how and where machines could be used
    to make decisions affecting a customer’s financial health, ensuring human oversight
    in critical decision-making processes. This structured risk identification and
    mitigation framework allowed the bank to prioritize risks, enforce proper controls,
    and ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI-driven initiatives.
    This approach exemplifies how financial institutions can effectively manage AI
    risks while leveraging the benefits of AI technologies.
