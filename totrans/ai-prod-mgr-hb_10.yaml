    success in all its various forms. Rather than exploring the performance of the
    models, we will be looking at performance from a product and growth perspective,
    including **value metrics**, **north star metrics**, **key performance indicators**
    (**KPIs**), and **objectives and key results** (**OKRs**) that companies can use
    to get early signals on whether their product strategy is successful and will
    lead to growth hacking. We will also be discussing how companies can prepare themselves
    to defend their product when it’s compared to other products.

    use to decipher whether things are going well or not. However, by far the greatest
    marker of whether your product is a good choice for the customers you’re looking
    to serve or not is to demonstrate that it works first and that the type of **artificial
    intelligence** (**AI**) you deployed in your product was the best choice for the
    job.

    demo to show them? Are you able to show them your product’s performance across
    a variety of datasets or does it only work well when you use your own data? Can
    you talk about the approach or algorithm you’re using without having to resort
    to the safe space of a *proprietary blend* that you’re not at liberty to discuss?
    Can you confidently get them in touch with partners or customers they can speak
    with to get a referral? Before you start to track the performance of your product
    for your sales or investment pitch, you will need to build trust within the ecosystem
    you’re a part of. Communicating success when there isn’t a foundation of strength
    will ring hollow.

    customers will be more cost-conscious than others, but at the end of the day,
    customers don’t forgo powerful products because of the price tag. If it works

    in [*Chapter 8*](B18935_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor246), but in this section, we will
    be expanding on value metrics, KPIs, and OKRs further through the lens of what’s
    best kept inside the business and what’s best communicated outward. Choosing metrics,
    particularly a north star metric, is a rigorous and meticulous activity, and it’s
    best done in a collaborative environment. You want to have a diversity of voices
    present when you’re making such foundational decisions. These are decisions that
    shouldn’t be taken lightly because, in many ways, the establishment of these norms
    will have downstream ripple effects that touch virtually all your internal teams

    related to evaluating your products’ AI/ML benchmarks, but in this chapter, the
    KPIs we will focus on will mostly relate to your general product’s KPIs and how
    that relates to your overall product strategy. Your product strategy is an extension
    of your product vision, establishing KPIs and metrics that reflect not just what
    your product’s goals are for its users but also what its users find most valuable
    about it.

- en: Choosing your product’s north star metric is an important part of aligning your
    product strategy with the realization of a key goal. It’s common for most products
    to be oriented toward one top metric that the company is using to track progress.
    Choosing the wrong one, or not choosing one at all, can have discombobulating
    influences on how your teams are built, guided, and measured. It can also have
    the unfortunate unintended consequence of not giving you a full picture of what’s
    happening on the customer side. This is particularly important with regard to
    the nascent AI/ML-native product because you want to make sure you’re getting
    an early signal on what’s working and what isn’t so that you can improve your
    product sooner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can also have a disruptive effect on how you choose to measure the success
    of your product overall. This is because the north star metric serves as your
    primary KPI. It doesn’t just unite your entire company around a common goal but
    it also communicates how well the company as a whole is performing. Using it tells
    folks internally and externally whether things are going well overall (or not).
    If you’re doing it right, you will have one metric to serve as an elegant indicator
    of revenue, performance, and engagement. The benefits of doing this are threefold.

    team but you’re also giving your product team a standard to stay accountable to
    and be measured against. These two systems working together create a feedback
    loop so that anyone at your organization can see, with a large degree of certainty,
    whether the ship is sailing the way it should be. This informs discussions that
    marketing, sales, logistics, finance, product, and customer success teams all
    have with each other, as well as within their own teams. If you’re a product manager,
    particularly one pioneering a novel AI product, we highly suggest you push for
    the establishment of a north star metric.

    has traditionally and often been measured on how much is built and shipped. However,
    establishing a north star metric is a strategic choice that benefits the product’s
    function and influence within the company. This is especially true for AI companies
    because of the novelty of AI and the strategic importance it has on the market
    today. Establishing a north star metric is a way of demonstrating to the entire
    organization that the product team is foundationally aligned with the success
    of the business and it reinforces the idea that the company is product-led and
    not sales-led.

    to your customers but also educating your product organization on potential areas
    of improvement and expansion as far as product features are concerned. This is
    doubly true for an AI product, which may have fault lines that traditional software
    products don’t have. Using KPIs to track several behaviors and performance benchmarks

    crucial difference. A **metric** is more of a generalized term that applies to
    something that can be quantifiably measured. A KPI relates to something specific
    that can be tracked and measured against key business objectives. Not all your
    metrics will relate to your top-line business objectives, but all your KPIs will
    be metrics. The point of using these is to see where there needs to be new growth
    in the adoption of your product. Maybe your north star metric tracks well, but
    there are dips in your other KPIs. This is an indicator that there might be new
    product areas to focus on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of KPIs and other metrics is meant to serve as an early warning sign
    to product managers and leaders about the strength, success, and usability of
    their product, but beyond that, they also are meant to paint a narrative about
    why something isn’t going well. This is why the orchestration of your KPIs and
    metrics is such a thought-intensive process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the moment, such as a bug or an issue with a page, but you also want to use them
    to help discover areas of the product experience that are suboptimal. You want
    to understand whether there is a problem with how your product is foundationally
    built versus whether there is a temporary problem with how the product is being
    deployed. Using an assortment of metrics to gauge the product experience overall
    is a best practice for product managers.

    real success or performance. They also don’t tell you what to improve on. Make
    sure any metrics you’re using, north star or otherwise, all provide the company
    with important insight.

    don’t actually help you in the long run because they aren’t actionable. There’s
    nowhere to go with that information if those unique visitors arrive accidentally
    or leave because something’s wrong, if the sessions are accidents or clickbait,

    To jog your memory, the idea behind **OKRs** is to tie certain results back to
    the overarching goals of the company or team. Usually, there are organizational-level
    OKRs, but individual teams and even individual people can also have them. They
    arise from a clear, defined goal and are matched with a series of success criteria
    to constitute the completion of that goal. You look at what you want to achieve
    and then you set guidelines for knowing when you’ve achieved it.

    originally designed. Even if you don’t use a CEP, a product analytics tool can
    still give you tons of insight into whether or not there are glaring issues from
    the outset. As the product continues to mature and evolve, it should also show

    about the success of your product agnostically as well because the truth is success
    comes from a collection of events. Your product needs to be communicated about
    with customers and users, but it also needs to be built in a way that directly
    solves their problems. Your data warehouse will serve as your main source of truth,

    sold in the past and this means that our responsibility as product managers is
    to offer an experience that aligns with how customers want to be regarded.

    anymore. Customers and users know they are being tracked and they’re putting us
    to the test. Customers and users want us to use our intelligence on them in order
    to give them an experience that won’t insult their intelligence and we’re here
    for it. It’s a brave new *help me, help you* world, and we think it’s about time
    we use all this data to make the UX simpler than it has ever been.

- en: This chapter concludes *Part 2* of our book, and so far, we’ve covered a wide
    variety of topics for the AI-native product. In this part, we discussed how AI/ML-native
    products are built and productized, and we also examined the notion of customization
    and verticalization within AI products, as well as a few popular ways AI capabilities
    and features are built into products. Understanding how AI products are natively
    built gives us good context for the next and final part of our book, which is
    about integrating AI into existing traditional software products. We will begin
    this third part of our book with [*Chapter 11*](B18935_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor361),
    which will focus on the pervasive influence of AI and the impact it has across
    industries.

    (**ML**) into their existing products because of the competitive advantage and
    strategic influence that AI has across industries.

- en: The third part of this book will focus on evolving existing products that don’t
    currently use ML or **deep learning** (**DL**) to leverage AI. In the previous
    part, we discussed building an AI-native product and how the process unfolds in
    a way that’s optimal from a data, company, and strategy perspective. Using this
    same lens, we will now compare and contrast how this process unfolds for products
    that don’t currently leverage AI. By the end of this part, we’ll understand the
    impact and scale AI is having on individual companies and the industries they’re
    a part of. We will end this part with a comprehensive guide to bringing AI/ML
    capabilities into traditional software products.
