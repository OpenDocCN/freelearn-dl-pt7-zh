- en: '**Karthik Raghunathan** is a scientist at Microsoft, Silicon Valley, working
    on Speech and Natural Language Processing. Since first being introduced to the
    field in 2006, he has worked on diverse problems such as spoken dialog systems,
    machine translation, text normalization, coreference resolution, and speech-based
    information retrieval, leading to publications in esteemed conferences such as
    SIGIR, EMNLP, and AAAI. He has also had the privilege to be mentored by and work
    with some of the best minds in Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, such
    as Prof. Christopher Manning, Prof. Daniel Jurafsky, and Dr. Ron Kaplan.'

- en: Karthik currently works at the Bing Speech and Language Sciences group at Microsoft,
    where he builds speech-enabled conversational understanding systems for various
    Microsoft products such as the Xbox gaming console and the Windows Phone mobile
    operating system. He employs various techniques from speech processing, Natural
    Language Processing, machine learning, and data mining to improve systems that
    perform automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. The products
    he has recently worked on at Microsoft include the new improved Kinect sensor
    for Xbox One and the Cortana digital assistant in Windows Phone 8.1\. In his previous
    roles at Microsoft, Karthik worked on shallow dependency parsing and semantic
    understanding of web queries in the Bing Search team and on statistical spellchecking
    and grammar checking in the Microsoft Office team.

- en: Prior to joining Microsoft, Karthik graduated with an MS degree in Computer
    Science (specializing in Artificial Intelligence), with a distinction in Research
    in Natural Language Processing from Stanford University. While the focus of his
    graduate research thesis was coreference resolution (the coreference tool from
    his thesis is available as part of the Stanford CoreNLP Java package), he also
    worked on the problems of statistical machine translation (leading Stanford's
    efforts for the GALE 3 Chinese-English MT bakeoff), slang normalization in text
    messages (codeveloping the Stanford SMS Translator), and situated spoken dialog
    systems in robots (helped in developing speech packages, now available as part
    of the open source Robot Operating System (ROS)).

- en: Karthik's undergraduate work at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut,
    focused on building NLP systems for Indian languages. He worked on restricted
    domain-spoken dialog systems for Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi in collaboration with
    IIIT, Hyderabad. He also interned with Microsoft Research India on a project that
    dealt with scaling statistical machine translation for resource-scarce languages.

- en: '**Altaf Rahman** is currently a research scientist at Yahoo Labs in California,
    USA. He works on search queries, understanding problems such as query tagging,
    query interpretation ranking, vertical search triggering, module ranking, and
    others. He earned his PhD degree from The University of Texas at Dallas on Natural
    Language Processing. His dissertation was on the conference resolution problem.
    Dr. Rahman has publications in major NLP conferences with over 200 citations.
    He has also worked on other NLP problems: Named Entity Recognition, Part of Speech
    Tagging, Statistical Parsers, Semantic Classifier, and so on. Earlier, he worked
    as a research intern in IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Universit√© Paris
    Diderot, and Google.'
