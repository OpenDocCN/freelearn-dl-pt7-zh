- en: The `beam_size` parameter in the Whisper model refers to the number of beams
    used in beam search during the decoding process. Beam search is a heuristic search
    algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited
    set. In the context of Whisper, beam search is used to find the most likely sequence
    of words given the audio input.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the output during sampling.
    A higher temperature produces more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes
    the model’s outputs more deterministic. When the temperature is set to zero, the
    model uses a greedy decoding strategy, always choosing the most likely next word.

- en: '`beam_size` and `temperature` influence the decoding strategy and the diversity
    of the generated text. A larger `beam_size` value can increase the accuracy of
    the transcription by considering more alternative word sequences, but it also
    requires more computational resources and can slow down the inference process.
    On the other hand, `temperature` affects the variability of the output; a nonzero
    temperature allows for sampling from a distribution of possible following words,
    which can introduce variability and potentially capture more nuances in the speech.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, the `beam_size` parameter is used when the temperature is set to
    zero, indicating that beam search should be used. If the temperature is nonzero,
    the `best_of` parameter is used instead to determine the number of candidates
    to sample from. The Whisper model uses a dynamic temperature setting, starting
    with a temperature of `0` and increasing it by `0.2` up to `1.0` when certain
    conditions are met, such as when the average log probability over the generated
    tokens is lower than a threshold or when the generated text has a *gzip* compression
    rate higher than a specific value.

    One such technique that has gained significant attention is the quantization of
    models, particularly in the context of ASR systems such as OpenAI’s Whisper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Quantization** is a family of techniques that aim to decrease a model’s size
    and prediction latency, primarily by reducing the precision of the model’s weights.
    For instance, this could involve decreasing the precision from 16 to 8 decimal
    points or converting from floating-point to integer representation. This process
    can significantly reduce memory requirements, enabling efficient deployment on
    edge devices and embedded platforms for real-time applications.'

    gaps and make the world more inclusive. It has improved inclusivity in applications
    such as the On Wheels app ([https://dataroots.io/blog/on-wheels](https://dataroots.io/blog/on-wheels)),
    a mobile application redefining accessibility in urban environments for wheelchair
    users, people with reduced mobility, and parents using a stroller or baby carriage.
    It provides a map that displays a wide range of practical information, such as
    the location of accessible restaurants, bars, museums, toilets, shops, parking
    spots, hospitals, pharmacies, and petrol stations. For instance, a user might
    say, “*Add a new accessible restaurant at 123 Main Street. The entrance is 32
    inches wide, and there is a ramp leading to the door. The restroom is also accessible,
    with a doorway width of 36 inches.*” The app, powered by Whisper, would transcribe
    this voice input into text. It would then extract the relevant information, such
    as the restaurant’s address, entrance width, presence of a ramp, and restroom
    accessibility details. This data would be added to the app’s database, making
    it available for other users searching for accessible locations in the area. The
    integration of Whisper AI into the On Wheels app has significantly improved the
    user experience for people with speech or hearing impairments. Whisper has been
    utilized to develop a voice assistant for the app. This voice-powered functionality
    caters to users who face typing or visual impairments, allowing them to participate
    more fully by using voice commands to interact with the app. Using **natural language**,
    the voice assistant enables users to provide information about locations they
    want to add to the app, such as the function of the building, the address, the
    entrance, or the toilet. This has increased inclusivity by allowing users who
    might not be able to use or contribute to the app’s accessibility information
    through traditional means to do so via voice. The app will enable users to personalize
    their experience based on the width of their wheelchair and the height of the
    doorstep they can manage, showing only locations that are easily accessible to
    them. Users can also contribute by measuring their favorite places in the city
    to help others enjoy them in the future.
