    and rib cage play pivotal roles in air inhalation and exhalation, providing the
    necessary airflow for voice production. This process begins with the strategic
    opening and closing of the vocal folds within the larynx, the epicenter of vocalization.

    20-year-old is estimated to know between 27,000 and 52,000 words, typically increasing
    to 35,000 and 56,000 by age 60\. Each of these words, when spoken, exists for
    a fleeting moment – often less than a second. Yet, the brain is adept at making

    comprehension abilities. Parallel processing means it can handle multiple tasks
    simultaneously. Unlike sequential processors that handle one operation at a time,
    the brain’s parallel processing allows for the simultaneous activation of numerous
    potential word matches. But what does this look like in the context of neural
    activity?

    distinctprocessing unit within the brain. These units are not physical entities
    but neuronal firing patterns within the cerebral cortex, **neural representations**
    of words. When we hear the beginning of a word, thousands of these units spring
    into action, each assessing the likelihood that the incoming auditory signal matches
    their corresponding word. As the word progresses, many units deactivate upon realizing
    a mismatch, narrowing down the possibilities. This process continues until a single
    pattern of firing activity remains – this is the **recognition point**. The active
    units suppress the activity of others, a mechanism that saves precious milliseconds,
    allowing us to comprehend speech at a rate of up to eight syllables per second.

    data interchange format. In the context of Whisper, the JSON output includes detailed
    information about the transcription, such as the task, language, duration, segments,
    and other metadata. Each segment contains the start and end times, the transcribed
    text, and other details such as average log probability, compression ratio, and

    be directly used as video captions.'

    text. Whisper can generate SRT files that can be used to add subtitles to videos.'

    not as commonly used as the other formats in the context of Whisper, but it can
    be helpful in specific applications where a simple, tabular format is needed.'

    JSON is great for applications needing detailed transcription metadata, while
    WEBVTT and SRT are ideal for video captioning or subtitling applications. TSV,
    on the other hand, provides a simple, tabular representation of the data.
